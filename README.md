# R for News Data

I'm writing a book using R-studio, bookdown and Git/Github.This is a great idea for a range of reasons including:

- easy access and web publication
- 

It'll be a short history of digital newspapers, an overview of where to find newspaper data, and some tutorials mostly using R.

I would love to have contributors and have made it open source.
