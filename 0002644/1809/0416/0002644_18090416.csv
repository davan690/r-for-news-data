The  surest  restraint  on  t  °Utica'  delinquincy  is  severity  of  popular  opinion  ;  and  the  highest  clemency  to  the  community  is  justice  to  offenders.  Strict,  inexorable  impartiality  'on  this  head  is  equally  beneficial  to  the  governing  and  the  governed  ;—it  places  men  in  power  on  their  guard;  reminds  them  incessantly  of  their  duty,  •  ac accompanies  companies accompanies  them,  as  a  severe  hut  useful  Monitor  ,  teaches  them  discretion,  if  it  cannot  inspire  them  with  virtue  ;  is  lan  infallible  antidote  against  the  poison  of  power,  and  pre prevents  vents prevents  those  violent  sanguinary  convulsions,  which  counter counteract,  act, counteract,  and  cast  off,  the  excessive  and  enfeebling  humours  of  despotic  governments  anti  vitiated  constitutiona.

The  question,  therefore,  is,  whether  such  an  addition  to  the  stock  already.  in  the  market  is  a  thing  to  be  wished,  or  depre deprecated.  cated. deprecated.  In  the  last  Session  of  Parliament,  the  time  of  the  House  was  taken  up  frota  day  to  day  with  the  complaints  of  the  West  Indian  Merchants,  and  it  was  at  length  deemed  necessary  to  faci facilitate  litate facilitate  the  consumption  of  sngar  by  allowing  it  in  the  Distilleries.  The  glut  in  the  market  was  so  great  that  sugar  was  become  per perfectly  fectly perfectly  unsaleable.  The  poorer  Piaaters  were  rained,  and  the  richer  were  only  enabled  to  continue  their  culture  upon  their  former  savings.  Under  such  a  state  of  circumstances,  the  Parliament  deemed  itself  called  upon  to  interpose,  and  as  we  have  before  sail,  open opened  ed opened  the  Distilleries  to  the  Sugar-growers.  This  was  a  serious  departure  from  principles  hitherto  deemed  fundamental.  It  has  always  hitherto  been  a  z  maxim  to  favour  the  English  Corp-grow Corp-growers  ers Corp-growers  in  preference  to  the  Foreign  Planters—This  system  was  now  done  away,  and  the  Farmer  and  Planter  put  on  a  level.  The  quantity  of  colonial  produce  in  the  market  so  far  exceeded  the  demand  as  not  only  to  justify  but  to  require  this  new  system.  In  such  a  state  of  things,  is  it  necessary  to  say  pitch  as  to  the  necessary  consequences  of  new  colonial  conquests.  If  the  market  be  already  glutted,  what  will  he  its  state  when  so  much  addi additional  tional additional  produce  is  thrown  into  it,—  when  the  competition  of  the  sellers  is  augmented  by  an  additional  island,  and  one-fourth,  per perhaps  haps perhaps  one  half,  is  added  to  our  already  bursting  warehouses.  There  is  another  consideration  of  some  importance.  The  an annual  nual annual  produce  of  Martinique  is,  as  we  have  said,  very  great;  but  its  actual  stock  on  hand  is  much  greater.  From  the  efficacy  of  the  general  bkckade  of  the  French  Islands,  by  the  English  cruisers,  the  Planters  of  Martinique  have  been  unable  to  send  their  stock  to  market--they  have  been  compelled  to  store  it,  and  it  is  not,  perhaps,  too  much  to  say,  that  the  warehouses  in  Martinique  must  probably  contain  the  produce  of  four,  five,  or  six  years.  All  this  quantity  will  now  be  released,  and  poured  into  the  English  market.—What  must  be  the  inevitable  conse consequence?—lf  quence?—lf consequence?—lf  there  was  before  a  glut,  will  not  such  a  produce  become  now  little  better  than  a  weed  ?—The  Dutch,  it  is  said,  annually  burn  their  spices,  to  prevent  an  over-abundance  in  the  market.

Under  certain  circumstances  plenty  is  lobe  wished,  but  under  others,  it  is  equally  ruinous  both  to  the  Planter  and  to  the  Pub Public.  lic. Public.  It  is  ruinous  to  the  Planter,  because  the  price  of  the  whole  is  jured  by  too  great  a  surplus.  Every  one  will  buy  at  his  own  price  where  there  are  more  who  want  to  sell  than  he  wants  to  buy—and  this  excessive  abundance  is  ultimately  equally  injurious  to  the  Public,  because  the  abundance  of  one  season  will  he  invariably  followed  by  the  scarcity  of  others— othersmany  many othersmany  will  abandon  a  cultivation  which  they  cannot  continue  ithout  the  prospect  of  ruin.  Upon  these  considerations,  we  must  panne  before  we  consider  the  conquest  of  Martinique  as  a  thing  of  any  public  value,  or  political  importance.  To  us,  indeed,  upon  the  first  appearance  of  thin  g  s,  it  seems  rather  a  conquest  than  an  acquisition.

He  would  not  on;  occupy  the  attention  of  the  Howe,  and  as  his  observations  were  unexpected,  he  would  not  require  either  an  immediate,  or  a  full  ansiyer  to  any  of  them-from  - STYLE=superscript  the  Noble  Secretary  of  State,  unless  his  Lordship  found  himself  perfectly  conyeleut  to  the  task  on  so  short  a  notice  as  the  present,  The  first  related  to  an  article  contained  in  the  treaty  of  alliaoce  concluded  with,  he  could  scarcely  say  whom  ;  for  at  the  o.ne  nt  %%  it  had  beet'  signed,  our  army  was  on  the  point  of  evacuating  Spain,  the  Supreme  Junta  were  dispersed,  and  Ferdinand  VII.  in  whose  name  it  was  concluded,  remained  a  prisoner  in  ihr  'hands  of  the  Frerch,  uncrowned  and  hopeless,  The  article  of  which  he  complained  hound  this  nation  to  acknoo  ledge  Ferdinand  VII.  his  heirs,  or  lawful  successors  (ascending  the  throne  with  the  consent  of  the  Spanish  nation)  as  the  wily  Sovereigns  of  Spain.

The  next  observation  related  to  a  promise  made  by  the  Noble  Secretary  of  State,  that  the  fullest  information  should  he  laid  before  the  House,  on  every  point  of  the  late  eampaigat:  Yet  one  of  its  most  oaportant  and  unfortunate  events,  the  surrender  of  the  squadron  at  Ferrol,  was  illustrated  only  by  two  letters  from  Admiral  Dc  Courcy  :  the  one  advising  Sir  David  Baird  to  protect  those  shit  s,  and  the  other  stating  their  loss  and  their  number,  His  Lordship  also  wished  that  a  more  detailed  :recount  of  the  lesser  sustained  by  our  army  in  Spain  should  he  prodored.  as  that  which  had  beets  given  was  evidently  evronenus  or  insufficient.

It  is  a  precious  reflection,  that  the  transition  from  this  pro!  , STYLE=superscript  perous  condition  of  our  countrv,  to  the  scene  which  has  for  some  time  been  distressing  us.  is  not  chargeable  on  any  unwarrantable  views,  nor,  as  trust,  on  any  involuntary  errors  in  the  Public  Councils,  Indulging  no  passions  which  trespass  on  the  rights  or  the  repose  of  other  nations,  it  has  been  Ow  true  glory  of  the  United  States  to  cultivate  peace  by  observing  justice,  and  to  en entitle  title entitle  themselves  to  the  respect  of  the  nations  at  war,  by  fulfilling  their  neutral  obligations  w  ill;  the  most  scrupulous  importialitN  .

This  nnexceptinnable  course  could  not  avail  against  the  in.  Justice  and  violence  of  the  Bellivrent  Powers.  In  their  rage  against  each  other.  or  impelled  by  more  direct  motives,  principles  of  retaliat  ion  have  been  introduced,  equally  contrary  to  universal  reason  and  acknowledged  law.  How  lung  their  arbitrary  edicts  will  be  continued,  in  spite  of  the  demonstrations,  that  not  even  a  pretext  for  them  has  been  given  by  the  United  States,  and  of  the  fair  and  liberal  attempts  to  induce  a  revocation  of  them,  can cannot  not cannot  be  anticipated.

Mr.  Rentir.y  was  proud  to  second  this  Itesolution,  and  wished  'lr.  Mellish  to  he  heard  iii  his  defence.

He  would  not  wade  through  the  minutes  of  evidence  to  chew  on  what  grounds  his  vote  had  proceeded,  but  would  tell  them  a  plain  story,  to  prove,  that  while  their  representative  he  had  acted  in  such  a  manner  as  to  ensure  the  approbation  of  his  own  breast.  and  that  he  had  ever  done  his  duty.  if  he  was  a  placeman  or  a  pensioner,  or  had  any  expectations,  or  had  been  bribed.  directly  or  iudirectly,  then  indeed  he  would  have  been  miserable,  but  he  challenged  any  man  present  to  accuse  him  of  such  thing,  or  to  ioty  that  he  had  not  always  conscientiously  and  diligently  attended  to  his  parliamentary  d►sties,  as  connected  with.  their  representation.  If  he  differed  with  them  on  a  political  subject,  it  was  the  head  of  his  offence.  Ile  had  voted,  after  be being  ing being  at  his  post  during  the  whole  investigation  in  the  House  of  COIIIIIIOIIA,  that  the  Duke  of  York  was  neither  guilty  of  corrup•  Lion  or  connivance,  and  his  opinion  was  unaltered  at  this  mo moment.  ment. moment.  Mr.  Waithman  replied  to  the  last  Speaker,  who  had  (he  said)  received  as  patient  a  hearing  as  any  one  under  his  circumstances  could  expect,  though  he  regretted  he  had  not  been  allowed  complete  latitude,  :ts  every  thing  he  could  sav  must  be  more  against  than  for  him.  lie  then  produced  a  hill  addressed  by  Mr.  :Mellish  to  the  Freeholders  of  Middlesex  at  the  last  election,  and  commented  upon  it  at  some  length,  concluding  with  ex  pressing  his  hopes,  that  the  County  would  never  be  guilty  of  a  repetition  of  their  folly  in  re-electing  hint.

Let  our  c•ruizers  speak  and  endorse  their  papert,  hut  allow  the  ships  to  proceed  on  their  voyage.

The  point  of  principal  interest  at  present  is  Rochefort  harhour,  from  whence  tidings  of  the  greatest  moment  may  be  daily  expected.  The  last  letters  which  have  been  re received  ceived received  from  thet  a  were  brought  by  the  Tonnant,  and  some  of  them  are  of  so  late  a  date  as  the  Bth  instaipt.  The  French  fleet  had  not  at  that  time  been  attacked  by  our  squadron,  for  want  of  the  asiistance  of  the  fire-ships,  for  whose  arrival,  as  the  enemy  were  hourly  endeavouring  to  f;  et  tarther  in  shore.  Admiral  Gambier  had,  it  is  said,  re resalved  salved resalved  to  wait  no  longer,  but  was  upon  the  point  of  coin coinnivecing  nivecing coinnivecing  his  operaroas  with  the  means  which  he  already  possessed.  In  order  to  supply  the  absence  of  regular  fire fireships,  ships, fireships,  the  following  transports,  the  Hercules,  the  Ocean,  the  Apollo,  and  the  Sally,  were  fitting  out  in  a  manner  proper  for  that  service  ;  and  the  most  important  news  may,  as  we  said  before,  he  daily  expected  from  that  quarter.  Upon  the  subject  of  the  unhappy  differences  which  have  there  taken  place,  we  shall  subjoin  the  following  particu particulars  lars particulars  which  have  come  to  our  knowledge  :  It  is  said,  that  upon  Lord  Cochrane's  joining  the  fleet,  Admiral  Gambiei  gave  orders,  that  a  boat,  boat's  crew,  and  an  officer,  should  instantly  be  provided  by  every  ship  under  his  command  ;  the  whole  of  the  men  being  required  to  volunteer.  Upon  receiving  these  orders,  Admiral  - STYLE=superscript  Harvey  addressed  his  ship's  company,  and,  after  stating  the  nature  of  them,  declared,  that  he  himself  in  his  own  person  volunteered,  and  invited  as  many  as  chose  to  follow  his  example  ;  in  consequence  of  which  the  greater  part  of  his  officers  and  men  enrolled  themselves  along  with  him.  A  list  of  these  being  conveyed  to  the  Caledonia,  Lord  Gambier's  flag-ship,  his  Lordship  is  r:  ported  to  have  stated,  that  these  were  not  generally  the  kind  of  volunteers  he  wanted  ;  as  Lord  Cochrane  was  to  command  the  expedition,  of  IA  Web  appointment  he  (Lord  Gambier)  had  himself  some  reason  to  complain,  iaasmuch  as  it  seemed  to  indicate  that  there  was  no  Officer  in  his  fleet  fit  to  take  charge  of  the  service;  but  that  Admiralty  Orders  to  this  effitct  had  been  received,  which,  of  course,  lie  must  obey.  Hereupon  Admiral  Harvey  is  stated  to  have  expressed  the  greatest  dissatisfaction,  and  to  have  bestowed  upon  Lord  Gambier  himself  epithets  of  other  qualities  than  those  which  he  has  evinced  in  his  profession,  such  as  ./esuist,  Methodist,  and  Psalm-singer;  and  all  this  in  the  presence  of  Captain  Bedford,  of  the  Caledonia,  who  desired  to  know  if  it  was  meant  that  this  reply  should  be  conveyed  to  the  Commander  in  Chief;  to  which  the  other  answering,  in  the  heat  of  passion,  in  the  affirmative,  the  communica communication  tion communication  accordingly  took  place,  and  the  letter  for  a  Court-  Martial  was  the  result.  We  are  extremely  sorry  for  any  occurrence  of  this  nature  in  the  fleet,  which,  nevertheless,  proceeds  from  a  feeling  most  characteristic  of  the  (r  eneral  spirit  of  the  British  navy,  namely,  a  jealousy  of  honour,  r STYLE=superscript  '  an  ardent  desire  to  be  in  the  midst  of  danger,  which  has,  perhaps,  in  the  present  instance,  broken  out  -  into  a  little  irregular  fit  of  spleen,  but  which  we  still  hope  will  involve  none  of  the  parties  concerned  in  any  serious  consequences.  Accounts  received  yesterday  state,  that  Lord  Cochrane,  with  his  usual  vigilance  and  promptitude.  observing  that  the  Enemy  were  erecting  in  Basque  Roads  a  battery  to  an annoy  noy annoy  our  ships  in  their  operations  against  the  French  slim slimdror,  dror, slimdror,  immediately  attacked  it,  and,with  two  long  24-poun 24-pounders,  ders, 24-pounders,  kept  up  such  a  fire,  that  it  was  speedily  demolished.

The  retL  , STYLE=superscript  .on  of  my  adopting  this  resolution  is,  that  I  consider  the  fate  of  this  country  drawing  near;  and  I  fear  that  this  city  will  be  very  soon  involved  In  the  same  calamity,  as  Oporto.  TII  French  first  appeared  before  that  place  on  the  27th  ult.  but  made  no  serious  attack  tilt  the  29th,  hen  about  9,001  entered  it,  with  scarcely  any  resistance,  the  armed  populace  Hs  ing  before  theta  in  all  directions.  They  would  find  about  200  pieces  of  artillery;  Much  of  which  is  brass,  and  an  immense  hoot,  for  the  bar  havinn  been  had,  no  ship  had  been  able  to  sail  ;  ,consequently  all  the  shipping  (arming  which  were  Ifi  English  vessels,  almost  all  !raided)  has  fallen  into  their.  hands.  It  is  not  in  my  power  to  give  the  Particulars  of  (hit  affair,  as  I  believe  no  one  h.  n  arrived  here  since  the  French  took  pessession  of  that  place;  lint  the  circutip.  stances  w  hich...occurfed,prev  Musty  to  their  arrival  are  horrible  in  the  ex  ti-erne.  On  the  'list,  the  molt  +  murdered  JO  AC  Di  Cu  NM  A,  of  Hadeninka,  Major  of  the  2d  regiment  ;  and  on  the  22d,  they  went  in  the  prison,  where  they  dragged  Loilt  I  01.1  v  uta.A  out  of  his  bed,  and  instantly  dispatched  hint  witli  kniVes;  fourteeu  others  .

After  IC.ving  wreaked  their  ve  n  .  seance  on  these  unfortunate  wretches,  th  e  mob  thro  w  open  the  prison  duties,  awl  released  all  the  prisoners  w  ithou,t  exception;  consequently  those  nefarious  Villains  are  again  let  loose  on  the  public.  it  is  reported  here,  that  the  French  have  about  20400  men  in  the  Neirth  of  Portugal,  and  v  e  expect  that  General  V  TCTO:t,  who  lu:s  un  , STYLE=superscript  toubteilly  gained  a  corhplete  victory  over  CcesTA,  will  cutter  I=6l-tug:ll  by  A  lcantara,  with  an  army  of  1  SA,OOO  men  ;  there  ;5.  besides,  a  force  of  'TOW  at  Salamanca.  therefore  fear  otir  t;-oop,  conistiog  of  uo  more  titan  15,006  elicetise,  can  do  taut  little.  Most  of  our  friends  at  Oporto  escaped  before  the  Preneh  entered  ;  those  who,  I  fear,  are  taken,  are  Mr:  and  Mrs.  ft.  and  Miss  11.  and  our  good  friend  the  Doctor,  who  conceived  himself  briund  to  stay,  because  he  had  otfered  his  services  in  the  line  of  his  •  Portuguese  PaperS  to  the  Sd  instant  have  likewise  beeti  received.

The  following  is  the  molt  interesting  - STYLE=superscript  intelligence  in  these  papers  i  LisuoN,  Monett  28.

The  rest  of  the  French,  in  Dumber  from  500  to  600,  had  retired  to  the  Fort  of  S.

There  are  letters  of  a  later  date,  which  state,  th:.t  no  the  23d,  Generat  CUCSTA  totally  destroyed  a  corp  s  Of  104  French  cavalry,  and  took,  from  460  to  'WO  prisoners.  No  distinct  inforniation  has  .been  reeeivedias  yet  of  the  movements  and  force  of  the  corps  commanded  by  VICTOR.

That  this  is  the  object  of  the  expedition  ig  apparent  ;  for  as  soon  as  we  take  Into  consi consideration  deration consideration  the  fermentation  which  exists  in  Gallicia,  the  cap capture-of  ture-of capture-of  Vigg  o,  the  movements  and  success  of  RoisANS.,  the  unsubdued  spirit  of  the  Astnrians,  the  force  organised  by  Dlarstial  BERESFORD;  and  the  position  maintained  by  Sir  lioniaT  Witgoiv—it  is  impossible,  then;  to  deny,  that  the  plan  of  operation::  pursued  by  SOULT  is  hazardous  in  the  extreme.

Whatever  be  the  event  of  CUESTA'S  efforts,  assisted  by  the  detachment  kvhich  General  BERESieRD,  has  already  sent  him,  the  force  under  Viciva  must  suffer  coniiide6bly  from  any  engagement  which  may  take  place  litween  him  and  the  Spanish  General.

The  expedition  vs  hich  sailed  from  Cove,  must  have  reached  Lisbon  long  before  SOULT  COU:d  have  approached  that  city  ;  and,  joined  to  the  force  already  there,  was  more  than  _adennatc  to  give  Vltava  a  warm  re reception,  ception, reception,  in  case  he  advanced.

The  enemy,  amounting  to  1,500  men  and  50  Officers,  were  compelled  to  surrender  prisoners  of  war,  to  be  con conveyed  veyed conveyed  to  England,  where  - STYLE=superscript  they  are  to  remain  until  duly  exchanged.  The  military  chest  and  450  horses  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  assailants;  which,  together  with  the  arms  and  ammunition  found  in  the  place,  were  delivered  by  Capt.

This  intelligence  is  of  the  highestjmportance  in  the  prey  sent  state  of  Portugal,  and  is  a  new  proof  that  the  spirit  of  the  Spaniards  is  not  broken  down,  as  has  been  foolishly  and  maliciously  imagined;  and  we  expect  to  hear  in  a  very  short  time,  that  the  Gallicians  .

AN  DIU,NV  LS,  D.D.  or  Sr.  JAMES's  CHURCH,  IN  PICCIDILLY.  APPREHENSIVE  of  innovation,  notwithstanding  they  were  solicitous  for  reformation,  the  Reformers  of  the  Church  of  England  did  not  effect  what  otherwise  they  might  have  accomplished.  Many  illustrious  characters,  communicating  within  the  pale  of  its  establishment,  have,  age  after  age,  regretted  the  incompleteness  of  the  protestant  reformation  ;  and  of  these  some  have  propoed,  at  various  times,  to  review  and  a:iend  our  national  liturgy.  it  is  not  probable,  however,  that  this  measure  would  now  be  productive  of  the  advantages  which  it  was  supposed  were  to  be  derived  from  it.  Almost  the  same  considera considerations  tions considerations  which  induced  its  primitive  reformers  to  avoid  the  extreme  of  innovation,  seem  to  apply,  with  equal  force,  at  this  day,  to  the  ceremonies  and  discipline  of  our  national  church.  Crown  with  its  growth  and  strengthened  with  its  strength,  it  appears  highly  ineligible  to  shake  those  habits  and  affections  by  which  the  people  of  this  country,  during  a  critical  succession  of  ages,  have  been  uniformly  induced  to  prefer  and  protect  the  established  religion  of  their  forefathers.  It  is  rarely  possible  to  do  whit  we  call  the  best.  Communities,  no  less  than  the  individuals  which  form  them.  must  submit  to  see  their  wishes  lirnted  by  events,  and  their  operations  circumscribed  b‘  ordinary  computations.  Our  reformers,  resembling  in  this  our  law lawgivers,  givers, lawgivers,  may  say,—as  did  Solon,  when  he  was  asked  whether  be  had  given  the  Athenians  the  best  of  laws  We  gave  them  the  best  of  those  institutions  that  they  would  have  received.  Enough  is  now  suggested,  though  more  might  be  urged  to  the  same  point,  to  explain  the  causes  of  what  many  pious  people  regard  as  defects  in  our  Liturgy  ;  and  to  chew,  that  to  efface  from  it  such  defects,  by  explaining.  difficult  por portions  tions portions  of  it,  by  obviating  objections  made  to  it,  and  by  en enforcing  forcing enforcing  the  ordinances  which  are  contained  in  it,  as  well  as  displaying  the  excellencies  which  abound  throughout  it,  requires  no  gammon  teacher,  but  one  vs  ho,  while  tanglit  by  truth,  is  also  perfectly  acquainted  Ns  ith  theological  distinctions.

Sunddy  Evening,  February  the  lgth.—Perhars  it  ought  to  be  premised,  when  I  am  entering  upon  the  performance  of  this  part  of  my  task,  that,  whatever  was  Me  atte:dion  paid  by  me  to  the  subjects  of  these  soccesiive  d'vourscs,  I  have  retained,  excepting  what  memory  may  reproduce,  ehing  more  than  some  short  notes  of  ail  that  fell  from  ninettt  preacher  whose  opinions  it  is  become  m  y  ice  to  examine.

Rowland  Hill,  eccentric  as  is  the  general  style  of  his  san santit(  tit( santit(  gnome,  once  justly  remarked,  referring  to  the  mysteries  which  are  acknowledged  to  characterise  revealed  religion,  that  there  is  such  a  thing  as  getting  os  er  Now,  if  this  be  true  of  Divine  Revelation  itself,  it  applies  with  still  more  force,  with  an  almost  irresistible  force,  to  many  of  those  pious  systems,  creeds  and  prayers,  drawn  by  hu human  man human  reason  from  4he  sources  of  divine  wisdom.  It  is  there therefore  fore therefore  oftner  found  easier  to  get  over  the  difficulties  insepa inseparable  rable inseparable  from  those  systems,  than  to  explain  them  ;  and  hence  it  happens,  that  - STYLE=superscript  wisest  expounders  of  theological  for formularies,  mularies, formularies,  anxious  to  do  more  than  enough,  frequently  ex excite,  cite, excite,  by  the  excess  of  their  zeal,  almost  as  many  doubts  as  their  wisdom  appeases.  Highly  as  [  respect  the  abilities  and  acquirements  of  the  present  Rector  of  St.  James's,  and  it  some  time  since  became  me  sincerely  to  express  my  opinion  of  him,  1  cannot  say  that  his  late  parochial  Lectures  on  our  Liturgy  properly  satisfied  sonic  of  those  scruples  by  which  many  legitimate  believers  are  still  induced  to  demur  to  certain  portions  of  the  Occasional  Cffices  contained  in  the  Book  of  COMMOD-  Prayer.'  Dr.  ndrewes,  indeed,  seemed  particularly  unsa unsatisfactory,  tisfactory, unsatisfactory,  however  ingenious,  in  his  solution  of  the  objec objections  tions objections  so  often  urged  against  the  office  of  Culmination  against  Sinners  ;  which,  though  last  in  our  spiritual  ordinances,  formed  the  subject  of  his  first  lecture.  Is  it  possible  to  ac acknowledge  knowledge acknowledge  the  Justice  of  the  Curses  contained  in  this  Office  of  the  Church,  without  implying  condemnation  to  our ourselves  selves ourselves  ?  Well  might  it.  be  retorted,  upon  each  of  those  who  join  in  this  Service,  Out  of  thine  own  mouth  will  1  con condemn  demn condemn  is  the  man,  or  the  %vomits,  that  liveth  and  sinneth  not  ?  Should  it  be  shown,  by  any  felicity_  of  explanation,  that  we  do  not  imprecate,  using  this  office,  on  ourselves,  the  punishment  doe  to  the  transgressions  of  which,  more  or  less,  every  individual  must  here  own  the  commission,  still  another  perplexity  occurs.  If  only  those  who  are  without  sin  arc  to  cast  the  first  stone  at  °Tenders,  where  i  3  the  soul  that  can  with  any  truth  denounce,  as  it  were,  upon  his  fellow-sinners,  the  Curse  of  the  Law  of  God  ?  By  avowing  the  justice  of  the  curses  recited,  in  the  ('ommina ('omminalion  lion ('omminalion  Sinners,  we,  however,  do  virtually  conkss  ourselves  obnoxious  to  them  ;  by  our  rintett,we  do,  think  as  we  may,  confirm  them  personally  ;  and,  so  confessing  and  confirming  them,  do  we  not,  in  fact,  implore  those  denunciations  which  we  declare  ourselves  to  .  have  most,  righteously  deserved  Theic  are  not  imaginary  things.

OLD  BAILLI.  Sourcing,  April  15.  John  Carr  was  indicted  fur  feloniously  shooting  at  a  police  officer  of  the  name  of  Edward  Rice,  with  intent  to  kill  and  murder.  The  statement  of  the  prosecutor  went  to  prove  that  at  seven  o'clock  in  the  evening  of  the  19th  of  lebruary,V  ickery,  an  officer  belonging  to  Worship-street,  together  with  another  man,  accompanied  him  on  the  look  out  for  robbers,  in  Stepney-  Fields,  and  they  saw  the  prisoner  and  an  other  man  whom  they  suspected  as  being  fit  for  their  recognizance.  - STYLE=superscript  Vickery  took  one  man  into  custody,  and  the  prisoner  ran  oil'.  Rice  followed  him,  and  having  gained  ground  on  him,  the  prisoner  discharged  the  contents  of  a  pistol  at  him,  and  he  was  afterwards  taken.  Sir  Souicier  Lawrence  here  interfered,  and  directed  the  Jury  to  acquit  the  prisoner,  as  the  indictment  could  not  stand.  The  Officer  was  attempting  to  apprehend  the  prisoner  without  any  authority,  and  if  he  had  been  shot  it  would  only  have  amounted  to  manslaughter.  The  conduct  of  the  officers  was  illegal,  and  they  were  not  warranted  in  seizing  a  man  whom  they  choose  to  suspect.  The  Prisoner  was  consequently  acquitted.  Zekiel  Lochleader,  alias  Thurston,  and  Robert  Lochleader  (brothers)  were  indicted  for  stealing  a  mare,  valued  at  fourteen  guineas,  the  property  of  John  Ashley.
