Our  institutions,  our  arms,  our  philosophy,  and  our  arts,  were  the  noblest  models  of  her  imitation,  the  most  fervent  objects  of  her  attainment.  If  a  change,  sup supposed  posed supposed  to  be  salutary,  was  proposed,  or  introduced  into  any  branch  of  the  Administration,  it  was  invariably  borrowed  from  our  customs.  fa  every  dispute  between  nation  and  nation,  we  were  referred  to  as  umpires;—the  oppressed  looked  up  to  us  as  avengers  ;  the  weak  as  protectors;  and  the  aggressor  dreaded  our  justice  and  resentment.

We  punish  the  sinner,  without  taking  any  trouble  to  remove  the  sin.  Does  it  never  occur  to  our  reasoners  on  adultery,  or  have  they  omitted  to  observe  it,  that,  in  nine  cases  of  ten,  as  the  discussion  respects  fashionable  society,  adultery  is  the  consequence  of  improper  marriages  ?  Nature  is  not  to  be  counteracted.  Emotions  native  to  the  human  feelings,  born  of  the  heart,  may  be  stifled,  for  some  time,  but  they  mill,  if  their  causes  recur,  eventually  set  all  dicipline  at  defiance.  It  is  vain,  perhaps  the  worst  of  folly,  to  oppose  artificial  distinctions  to  natural  sensations.  The  question  of  adultery,  with  reference  to  society  generally,  is  not  very  difficult.  (t  reat  people  can  act;  middling  people  would  act  ;  lower  people  do  not  act.

Mr.  Wismar:an  now  rose  to  make  the  Motion  of  which  he  had  given  such  frequent  previous  He  spoke  in  sub substance  stance substance  as  follows  :—Whilst  I  am  plea,  ►og  the  cause  of  right,  and  therefore  the  cause,  the  concerns  of  all  nations,  let  me  not  be  accused  with  wanting  a  due  feeling  for  my  own  country,  with  pleading  the  cause  of  the  stranger  or  the  enemy  against  oarselves.  Truth,  honesty,  and  fair  dealing,  are  the  common  cause  of  all  nations;  and  when  I  plead  that  my  country  should  act  rightly,  and  that  it  should  act  honestly,  I  neces necessarily  sarily necessarily  plead,  at  the  same  time,  its  true  and  genuine  in interests.  terests. interests.  Never  can  1  take  the  part  even  of  my  Country  against  what  is  right,  because  never  can  I  coercive  the  true  interests  of  my  country  advanced,  by  departing  from  such  line'  of  rectitude.  The  result  of  the  whole  system  has  verified  my  pre prediction,  diction, prediction,  but  I  owe  it  to  my  Honourable  Friends  to  mention,  by  the  way,  that  in  the  Order  of  the  7th  of  January  they  had  on  idea  of  the  extent  which  a  subsequent  Ministry  would  give  to.  this  act—they  had  no  possible  idea,  that  what  was  meant  as  an  experiment  would  be  adopted  as  an  approved  precedent,  that  an  exception  to  their  general  policy  would  be  pleaded  as  a  rule,  and  that  they  would  be  thus  interpreted  into  what  they  would  never  have  intended.  Had  the  Continent  taken  arms  against  Bonaparte  ?  Had  the  soldiers  refused  to  march,  because  they  wanted  coffee  and  sugar  for  breakfast  ?  And  as  to  Ame America,  rica, America,  how  had  America  taken  it  ?  Had  she  pocketed  the  af•  front  as  predicted  by  the  Right  Honourable  Gentleman  ?  No  I  for  no  sooner  had  intelligence  of  the  Orders  reached  America,  than  the  American  Government  expressed  their  opinion  of  them.  From  these  considerations,  Sir,  I  say  that  the  Ministers  would  have  done  well  had  they  paused  to  revise  their  own  acts,  had  they  acted  under  their  experience,  and  become  wise  hy  the  effects  of  their  errors.  The  point  of  truth  is,  that  our  Government  had  not  the  due  spirit  of  conciliation.  They  had  disavowed  the  act  of  Admiral  Berkley,  but  they  had  not  reprimanded  him.  He  had,  indeed,  been  recalled  from  that  station  ;  but,  as  if  to  shew  that  he  bad  not  lost  the  confidence  of  Ministers,  and  that  they  did  not  blame  the  spirit,  though  they  could  not  justify  the  act,  he  was  ostentatiously  sent  out  on  another  service,  as  soon  as  he  had  returned  from  the  American  station.  If  the  war  goes  on,  can  we  expect  to  retain  Canada,  or  even  our  insular  possessions  in  the  West  Indies  ?  It  would  be  a  war  ruinous  on  its  result,  and  would  he  productive  of  the  most  calamitous  consequences.  The;  hole  world  would  he  against  us,  and  we  should  scarcely  have  :t  resource  to  apply  to.  We  should  recollect  the  millions  of  debt  which  our  merchants  are  unable  to  recoverirom  America,  and  the  incalculable  losses  they  sustain  from  the  suspension  of  their  intercourse  with  that  country.  The  Honourable  Member  concluded  by  moving,  That  an  humble  Address  be  present presented  ed presented  to  his  Majesty,  representing,  that  in  consequence  of  the  passing  of  a  Decree  at  Berlin,  and  the  alledged  acquiescence  of  America  in  the  said  Decree,  his  Majesty  has  been  pleased  to  issue  his  Order  in  Council,  relative  to  the  said  Decree,  and  that  the  said  Orders  were  followed  up  by  certain  acts  (luring  the  en ensuing  suing ensuing  session  of  Parliament,  in  which  a  power  was  reserved  to  his  Majesty  of  annulling  the  said  Orders  if  it  should  be  conceiv conceived  ed conceived  expedient.  That  in  consequence  of  such  Orders  in  Council,  the  Congress  of  America  conceiving  they  interfered  with  their  interests,  anti  exposed  their  system  to  such  innovations  as  they  did  not  think  were  consistent  with  their  views,  they  parsed  a  law  laying  an  embargo  on  all  American  ships  in  their  own  ports,  at  the  same  time  offering,  that  if  we  would  rescind  our  Orders  in  Counci!,  that  we  should  have  the  exclusive  commerce  of  that  country,  by  which  means,  our  interests,  in  other  respects,  would  he  essentially  improved  ;  that  this  offer,  so  just  in  principle,  and  in  tendency  so  highly  advantageous  to  Great  Britain,  we  believe  and  hope  k  still  open  for  hi:  Majesty  to  receive.  That  the  con continuance  tinuance continuance  of  the  Embargo,  is  manifestly  injurious  to  this  country  and  to  our  commercial  interests  ;  most  humbly  praying  that  his  Majesty  will  be  graciously  pleased  to  adopt  such  measures  113  may  open  a  course,  and  by  a  temperate  and  judicious  negociation  lead  to  a  decision,  conducive  to  the  interests  and  welfare  of  his  Majssty's  subjects.

The  trade  of  England  was  certainly  in  a  great  measure  gone,  but  it  was  from  the  Decrees  at  Berlin,  and  not  fr  in  the  Orders  in  Council.  It  was  necessary  to  resussitate  the  commerce,  and  Ministers  were  oblig  ed  to  take  measures  fur  that  purpose.  The  trade  of  England  for  the  two  years  preced.  ing  the  10th  of  October,  1807,  was  certainly  but  nominal.  On  the  passing  of  the  Orders  in  Council,  however,  instead  of  a  further  continnance  of  so  disastrous  a  calamity,  the  trade  pro progressively  gressively progressively  increased,  and  the  prophecy  to  which  the  Honourable  Gentleman  alluded,  instead  of  failing,  was  fulfilled  to  the  utmost  extent  of  the  expectations  of  Ministers.  The  Orders  in  Council  became  therefore  a  measure  of  utility,  and  of  general  benefit.—  He  showed,  from  the  history  of  the  reign  of  Phiiip  11.  of  Spain,  that  measures  similar  to  our  Orders  in  Council  had  been  exe executed  cuted executed  by  the  Dutch  Government,  which  were  acq6iesceci  in  by  that  monarch  and  the  other  potentates  of  Europe  ;  and  from  hence  he  argued,  that  the  assertion  that  this  measure  of  ours  was  unparalleled,  was  untrue.  He  thought  that  the  propositions  of  America  were  illusive  and  inoperative.  We  did  not  want  to  drive  America  to  a  war  with  France;  that  was  a  mistaken  no notion  tion notion  entertained  by  the  Hon.  Gentleman,  all  we  wanted  her  to  do,  was  to  abstain  from  trading  with  France  and  other  countries,  as  long  as  they  interdicted  her  trading  with  us.  The  Honourable  Gentleman,  concluded,  by  observing,  that  the  Orders  in  Council  were  measures  of  retaliation,  perfectly  consistent  with  the  ho honour  nour honour  and  dignity  of  this  country,  and  compatible  with  the  duty  of  his  Majesty's  Ministers;  and  with  this  impression  on  his  nauti  li  he  could  never  consent  to  the  Honotwable  Gentleman's  &amp;notion,  in  as  much  as  the  rescinding  of  those  Orders  was  the  chief  object  aimed  at  by  him  in  bringing  forward  the  subject  be before  fore before  Parliament.  On  the  question  being  put,  there  appeared,  for  the  Address  83,  against  it  145—majority  6'4—Adjourned.  Tuesday,  March  7.  MUTINY  BILL.  The  Order  of  the  Day  for  taking  into  further  consideration  the  report  of  the  Mutiny  Bill  having  been  read,  On  the  motion  of  the  S  t  CAETARY  at  `VAR,  the  Bill  was  or ordered  dered ordered  to  be,  and  was  forthwith  recommitted.  Several  amendments  were  proposed  by  the  Secretary  at  War.  The  first  was,  to  exempt  from  billetting  those  canteens  which  were  not  fit  for  that  purpose.  Another  amendment  was,  to  exempt  waggons  emploved  in  ir,i;itary  purposes  from  the  opera operation  tion operation  of  the  Act  of  Parliament  by  which  the  relations  of  weights  and  the  number  of  horses  were  adjusted.

The  succeeding  amendment  related  to  the  ab absconding  sconding absconding  of  recruits.

Wednesday,  March  8.  Lord  Fo  Licsro  NE  gave  notice  that  he  should,  on  Monday  ?e'ilight,  bring  forward  some  farther  Charges  against  His  Royal  Highness  the  Duke  of  York.  165  mast  ever  claim  my  warmest  thanks.  To  my  Honourable  Friend  (Mr.  Whitbread)  I  owe  much  ;  at  the  moment  I  felt  my myse!  se! myse!  f  a  good  deal  overpowered  at  an  earl  N  stage  of  the  business,  he  stepped  forward,  and  I  was  mulled  to  proceed  unt;sr  his  shield.  At  an  early  period  of  this  ins  sstigation,  I  had  the  mis misfortune  fortune misfortune  to  lose,  from  ill  health,  my  Ilonourable  Friend,  who  took  so  conspicuous  a  part  in  the  commencement  of  these  pro proceedings  ceedings proceedings  (Sir  Francis  Burdett).  To  ms  N  (role  Friend  (Lord  Folkstone)  L  owe  much.  —My  Nook  Friend  stepped  for forward,  ward, forward,  not  only  to  assist  me,  hut  he  placed  himself  in  the  same  situation  to  act  with  me  as  the  accuser  of  his  Ito)  al  Highness  the  Duke  of  York.  Tl  ., STYLE=superscript  e  conduct  of  his  Alajests  's  Ministers  upon  this  occasion,  must  convince  the  world,  that  as  long  as  any  thing  could  be  done,  they  had  given  very  great  credit  to  the  conduct  of  his  Royal  Highness.  Yet  it  is  the  duty  of  this  House  to  maintain  the  Rights  of  the  People,  as  it  is  the  duty  of  his  lat latjesty  jesty latjesty  s  servants  to  maintain  those  of  the  Crown.  And  I  think  the  event  of  this  Inquiry  will  be  developed  in  the  strength  of  the  ca.,ei  I  have  to  advert  to,  upon  which  1  rely,  to  prove  the  Charges  with  which  1  set  out  to  the  fullest  e  %tent.  I  have  brought  forward  the  exchange  between  Cols.  knight  and  Brooke.  It  ap appeared  peared appeared  that  some  delays  and  impediments  had  taken  place  in  that  exchange,  and  that  a  sum  of  200/.  was  offered  to  Mrs.  Clarke  to  expedite  the  exchange.  This  is  proved  in  the  first  place  by  the  evidence  of  Dr.  Thynne,  who  stated,  that  he  ha  d  applied  to  Mrs.  Clarke  respecting  the  exchange  of  Colonel  Knight  and  Colonel  Brooke;  and  for  the  purpose  of  inducing  Mrs.  Clarke  to  we  her  influence  with  the  Commander  in  Chief  to  expedite  the  exchange,  he  offered  her  the  sum  of  WO.  in  order  to  remove  those  impediments  and  those  delays.  Dr.  Thynne  is  corroborated  by  Mr.  Robert  Knight,  who  stated,  that  he  had  authorised  Dr.  Thynne  to  offer  Mrs.  Clarke  that  sum;  and  that  this  sum,  upon  the  exchange  being  effected,  was  paid  to  Mrs.  Clarke;  that  ap application  plication application  had  been  made  to  the  Duke  of  York  in  the  regular  way,  and  the  usual  official  answer  received;  that  great  delay  had  taken  place,  and  that  in  order  to  expedite  the  business,  he  had  applied  to  Mrs.  Clarke  to  use  her  influence  on  the  occasion.  This  evidence  is  further  corroborated  by  Mrs.  Clarke,  who  stated,  that  in  consequence  of  the  application  of  Dr.  Thy  n  ne,  she  had  applied  to  the  Commander  in  Chief  upon  the  subject  of  the  exchange;  that  she  gave  his  Royal  Hig  hness  the  Duke  of  York,  a  slip  of  paper;  that  the  Duke  asked  her  if  she  knew  the  parties,  to  which  she  answered  she  did  not,  but  that  they  were  to  make  her  a  compliment;  and  that  she  afterwards  re received  ceived received  the  sum  of  two  hundred  pounds.  Mrs.  Clarke  goes  on  to  state  farther,  that  upon  mentioning  the  subject  to  his  Royal  Ilil  o  rhness,  he  said  he  knew  the  subject  very  well  ;  that  they  had  been  trying  about  it  for  some  time  ;  and  it  appeared  from  the  documents  on  the  table,  that  Mrs.  Clarke  could  obtain  this  infor information  mation information  through  no  other  person  but  his  Royal  Highness  him himself.  self. himself.  Mrs.  Clarke  also  states,  that  she  shewed  the  VOW.  she  had  received  from  Colonel  Knight  to  his  Royal  Highness.,  and  that  the  day  after  she  received  it,  the  Duke  left  tow  n  for  Wey.  mouth.  Colonel  Gordon  corroborated  his  Royal  Highness's  go  ing  out  of  town  for  Weymouth  on  the  31st  of  July.  Mr.  It.  Knight  spoke  of  his  having  paid  the  'IOW.  early  on  the  day  after  his  brother  had  been  gazetted.  Mrs,  Clarke  further  ;IyF  i  ,  that  the  note  was  changed  by  one  of  the  -ersaats  of  his  Rim)  at  Highness;  and  Pearson,  Mrs.  Clarke's  butler,  states  positively,  that  on  the  night  before  his  Royal  Highness  went  out  of  town,  she  received  a  note,  which  was  changed  at  Mrs.  Bridgeroates,  the  pastry-cook's,  and  Mrs.  Bridge  titan  corroborated  this  fact.  There  appeared  a  great  confusion  in  part  of  Pearson's  testimony,  where  his  recollection  was  imperfect;  but  from  the  positive  tes testimony  timony testimony  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  from  the  recollection  •,f  Mrs.  Bridge Bridgeman,  man, Bridgeman,  that  the  man  came  to  her  to  get  the  change,  I  do  still  say,  there  is  every  reason  to  give  some  attention  to  the  facts  in  this  part  of  the  evidence.  Mrs.  Clarke  asserted,  that  there  was  only  two  or  three  days  from  the  time  of  the  application  for  the  ex,  change,  and  the  time  of  gazettieg.  But  Dr.  Thyane  and  Mr.  Knigt  spoke  positively  that  there  was  a  fortnight  or  three  weeks,  for  Mr.  Knight  went  three  times  to  the  Gazette  Office.  There  was  very  little  doubt  that  Mrs.  Clarke  made  the  applica application  tion application  to  his  Royal  Highness  immediately  after  Dr.  Thynne  had  spoken  to  her  requiring  her  dispatch.  Acid  after  this,  is  the  Duke  of  York  to  be  held  forth  us  being  wholly  ignorant  of  these  transactions)  and  can  it  he  supposed,  after  this,  that  Mrs,  Clarke  could  be  so  anxious  to  'keep  these  transactions  a  secret  from  the  Juke?

But  it  is  rather  a  peculiar  cir circianstvice,  cianstvice, circianstvice,  that  this  officer,  who,  when  you  deduct  She  seven  years  on  half-pay,  had  only  served  five  years,  is  con considered  sidered considered  a  proper  man  to  put  at  tta  head  of  a  cavalry  regiment,  in  which  service  he  had  la  - STYLE=superscript  yen  but  four  months  !  Tha.,  case  certainly  militates  strongly  against  those  very  regu regutat  tat regutat  i  ous  made  by  his  Royal  Highness  himself.  The  next  case  I  come  to  is  that  of  Capt.  Mating.  It  may  be  in  the  recollection  of  the  'louse  the  way  thiscase  was  taken  up,  and  that  it  was  not  ma mana.asd  na.asd mana.asd  at  all  in  the  way  in  which  I  wished.  'While  this  gentleman  had  never  been  out  of  England;  and  I  with  to  bring  it  to  this  point,  whether  it  Is  not  highly  improper,  not  to  say  corrupt,  in  any  Commander  in  Chief,  to  put  men  who  had  never  been  out  of  England,  over  the  heads  of  officers  who  had  served  so  many  years  in  foreign  climates  ?  During  the  progress  of  this  case,  it  appeared  that  another  Capt.  Maling  was  employed  in  the  Com Comma!'  ma!' Comma!'  ler  in  Chief's  office,  who  Never  rendered  any  service,  nor  never  llad  joined  his  regiment;  that  Colonel  Gordon  had  recom recommended  mended recommended  him  to  the  Commander  in  Chief  to  he  put  upon  half  pay,  and  to  enjoy  the  rank  of  Captain.  Now,  if  it  Wag  extraordi extraordinary  nary extraordinary  that  Mr.  Mating,  who  bad  never  been  out  of  England,  should  be  put  over  those  who  had  seen  service;  it  was  almost  as  extraordinary  to  give  this  gentleman  half-pay,  who  had  never  joined  his  regiment;  and  if  I  am  not  very  wrong;  there  is  an  Act  of  Parliament,  that  an  officer  cannot  be  put  on  half-pay  sinl•-ss  he  has  joined  his  regiment  and  served.  I  think,  therefore,  that  a  necessary  inference  arises  here,  that  there'  has  been  very  great  abuse  of  this  power,  which,  in  my  mind,  ong,ht  not  to  be  entrusted  without  limit  to  any  Commander  in  Chief  whatever.  The  next  case  I  come  to  is  that  of  Col.  French's  Levy.  The  evidence  of  Captain  Huxley  Sandon,  of  Mr.  Dowler,  of  Mr.  Grant,  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  Miss  Taylor,  fully  corroborate  each  •  other  upon  that  case.  The  terms  of  this  levy  was  500  guineas  to  Mrs.  Clarke;  this  money  vs  as  paid  when  the  letter  of  service  - STYLE=superscript  was  granted.  Mr.  Corgi  acted  as  the  agent,  and  received  2001.  for  the  introduction.  Mr.  Howler's  evidence  corroborates  this,  and  states,  that  he  remonstrated  with  Mrs.  Clarke  upon  the  im impropriety  propriety impropriety  of  the  transaction.  Mr.  John  Grant,  agent  to  the  levy,  stated,  that  the  letter  of  service  was  obtained  through  the  influence  of  Mrs.  Miss  Taylor's  evidence  was  corrobo corroborative  rative corroborative  t,f  all  these  facts;  and  Birkett,  the  jeweller,  from  whom  the  service  of  plate  was  purchased,  further  proved  the  purchase  of  the  plate,  the  bills  drawn  on  His  Royal  Highness  by  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  these  being  paid  afterwards  by  drafts  of  His  Royal  flightless  upon  Coutts.  Upon  her  evidence,  Mrs.  Clarke  says,  that  Captain  Bandon  applied  to  her  fifty  times  about  the  levy  ;  that  she  was  teased  to  death  by  him,  and  that  she  gave  his  letters  to  his  Royal  Highness  ;  that  the  communications  upon  it  continued  Sy  17:01105  ;  that  the  parties  continued  from  titne  t.  time  to  send  her  rn:mey  ;  she  seems  as  much  aware  of  official  reaularity  as  Col.  Gordon  himself,  or  any  other  officer  in  the  Ci•annander  in  Chief's  oiiiee,  and  tells  bins  that  official  rei.,ularic  mita  be  attended  to,  that  he  should  receive  certain  papers  tlarouali  the  Office  in  the  usual  way.  In  another  letter  (No.  11),  she  tells  C'tpta  in  Salaam  that  she  itaa  commu communicated  nicated communicated  his  •praposal  Ole  Duke  of  lark  ;  dint  she  sec  him  at  V;sus  and  com,nunicate  further.  Now  this  surely  is  a  direct  communication  from  the  Duke  of  lurk  to  Captain  MA  RCH  12.  Sandon,  through  Mrs.  Clarke.  There  is  no  extension  of  ti.:e  letter  of  service  to  Germany,  and  yet  Colonel  French  takes  upon  himself  to  send  parties  to  Germany.  If  there  we.:e  no  offi official  cial official  documents  to  authorise  Col.  French  to  enlist  Germans,  the  inference  is,  that  it  was  done  upon  11Irs.  Clarke's  au authority  thority authority  alone.  I  shall  have  no  difficulty  in  proving  that  some  of  the'oflicers  of  Colonel  French's  did  go  to  Germany,  and  that  some  men  were  enlisted.  The  next  letter  I  allude  to  is  from  Mrs.  Clarke  to  Capt.  Sandon,  telling  him  the  Duke  was  very  angry  about  the  levy,  that  the  last  time  he  saw  him  he  promised  him  SOO  Germans,  and  he  had  not  raised  one,  &amp;c.  ithout  further  commentary,  I  OWE  this  is  sufficient  prOof  that  in  the  German  levy,  Capt.  Sandon  had  failed,  and  did  not  get  the  numbers  promised  to  Ills  Royal  llighness,  which  he  could  not  have  known  hut  through  Mrs.  Clarke.  In  addition  to  the  evidence  of  Dowler,  I  think  there  can  he  no  doubt  On  the  mind  of  any  one  that  Mrs.  Clarke  did  possess  influence  with  the  Catninander  in  Chief,  and  that  in  this  levy  she  used  it.  The  next  question  is,  whether  it  was  known  to  the  Corn:.  mander  in  Chief  that.  she  received  pecuniary  compensa compensation  tion compensation  ?  Mrs,  Clarke  says  she  did  communicate  this  circum circumstance  stance circumstance  to  His  Royal  Highness.

STYLE=superscript  His  Royal  Highness  must  have  heea  aware  of  her  having  paid  the  5001.  to  Ilirkett  for  plate,  from  the  circumstance  of  his  giving  his  hills  for  thes  balance.—The  next  'point  arises  out  of  Official  '  Documents  relating  to  French's  levy.  By  his  letter  of  service  in  1501,  he  was  expected  to  raise  5000  men;  hut  to  discontinue  the  levy  if  4000  Were  not  raised  and  passed  in  nine  months.  In  seven  months  they  had  not  raised  beyond  two  hundred  men  ;  and  contrary  to  the  usual  practice,  and  in  violation  of  the  regulations,  indulgence  is  r,rauled,  and  the  bounty  incceased  from  fifteen  to  seventeen  gui guineas.  neas. guineas.  A  remonstrance  *was  sent  to  the  War  Office,  by  General  Taylor,  Inspector  of  Recruits  in  Ireland  ;  and  from  Lieut-Col.Ro Lieut-Col.Robinson;  binson; Lieut-Col.Robinson;  of  the  London  District,  after  making  several  direct  charges,  stated,  that  Colonel  reneh's  levy  was  without  a  man.  This  Report  is  sent  to  the  Commander  i  3  Chief's  Otliee,  but  in instead  stead instead  of  stopping  the  leVy,  nothing  but  Mrs.  Clarke's  influence  could  have  induced  his  Royal  Highness,  having  such  a  Report  laid  before  him,  to  continue  the  levy.  But  being  coovineed  of  the  truth  that  the  country  was  pay  ing  at  the  rate  of  'JO/.  per  man,  how  could  hiS  Royal  Highness,  with  this  long  detail  anti  positive  assertions  upon  the  suldect,.  have  let  this  system  go  on  in  direct  contradiction  of  the  letter  of  Service,  and  against  the  interests  of  the  country  ?  The  next  letter  upon  this  subject  hi  front  General  Whitelocke  to  Colonel  'Taylor,  submitting  the  propriety  of  discontinuing  the  levy,  and  calling  his  Royal  High Highness's  ness's Highness's  attention  to  it  ;  when  it  appeared,  that  out  of  4000  men,  only  219  men  had  been  raised  in  seven  months;  and  It  strikes  me,  that  unless  General  IS'  hitelneke  had  interfered,  'the  levy  would  never  have  been  stopped  at  all.

From  the  evidence  en'  at  the  bar,  and  from  the  documents  upon  the  table,  it  appears  e%ident,  that  for  every  guinea  Mrs.  Clarke  received  the  people  paid  eighty  pounds!

He  maintained  that  the  whole  of  this  disappointment  to  the  views  of  Major  Shaw.  arose  from  the  circumstance  of  his  having  fallen  short  of  giving  to  Mrs.  Clarke  that  10001.  which  he  stipulated  to  give  to  her  on  his  appoinnueat  to  the  rank  of  Co Colonel  lonel Colonel  ;  but  in  which  he  was  disappointed  ;  and  was  put  on  half halfpay,  pay, halfpay,  only  havine  the  nppointmeut  of  Barrack-Mrener-General  at  the  Cape  of  Good-Hope.—The  next  case  which  he  took  notice  of  was  the  case  of  Mr.  Dowler,  for  the  appointment  of  whom  he  read  from  the  evidence  of  that  witness.  that  Le  gave  to  Mr  s  .

With  respect  to  the  specific  charges,  he  was  not  inclined  to  enter  into  minutia.  lie  •  would  leave  it  to  other  Grentlemen  more  recently  conversant  in  such  matters.  But  he  must  observe,  that  in  the  ease  of  Colo Colonel  nel Colonel  knight,  there  was  no  testimony  whatever  which  could  con connect  nect connect  his  Royal  Highness  with  any  thing  which  could  be  regard-  •  ed  as  criminal  in  the  transaction.  This  business  rested  solely  on  the  evidence  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  there  was  no  testimony  to  show  that  the  Illustrious  Personage  in  question  had  any  knowledge,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  of  the  affair.  The  note  of  a  hun hundred  dred hundred  pounds,  said  to  have  been  changed  by  Lodowick,•was  not  identified  in  any  way,  and  may  therefore  i.,e  fairly  supposed  to  form  a  part  of  the  ample  allowances  made  to  Mrs.  Clarke  by  the  Illustrious  Personage  in  question.  But  there  were  other  circumstances  to  show,  that  the  appoitameat,  of  Co;ottel  Nnight  was  not  procured  through  the  intervention  of  .  Mrs.  Clarke.  W  ith  respect  to  the  case  of  Capt.

That  Gentleman  had  been  fairly  promoted  on  the  recornmea:  s  stion  of  General  Fraser,  an  officer  of  distinguished  merit  and  w  most  undoubted  integrity.  The  fact  which  had  been  so  sroresly  . STYLE=superscript  relied  upon,  that  Captain  Mating  was  still  to  be  found  at  Mr.  Greenwood's  desk,  was  disproved  by  the  testimies  of  Colonel  Gordon,  who  had  clearly  stated  to  the  Committee,  that  in  his  opinion  there  was  not  to  be  found  in  the  army,  for  the  chink  he  held,  a  more  meritorious  officer  than  Captain  .  He  next  came  to  that  part  of  the  charges  which  ielateti  to  Col.

Mr.  Burton  nese  iitered  into  a  long  detail  of  reasoning,  for  the  purpose  of  ,:ltew  it:;;  that,  in  the  single  conversation  which  had  occurs:at  respect respecting  ing respecting  Colonel  French's  levy,  there  did  not  appear  any  psoia'ss  hat hatever  ever hatever  that  his  Royal  Highness  had  been  influenced,  in  Cie  course  of  that  transaction,  by  ,motives  in  the  slightest  degree  improper  •or  corrupt.  In  the  consideration  of  Captain  Tonyu's  case,  it  was  stated,  that  the  sum  of  3001.  had  been  paid  to  Airs.  Clarke.  But  what  was  the  real  fact?  The  interference  of  sirs.

0015,"THE  NATIONAL  REGISTER.  Colonel  Gordon.  He  next  called  the  attention  of  the  Gen Gentlemen  tlemen Gentlemen  to  the  mysterious  note  which  had  been  the  subject  of  such  lengthened  V STYLE=superscript  and  minute  discussion.  It  was,  however,  viewed,  in  whatever  way  considered,  that  kind  of  testimony  which,  in  a  court  of  law,  where  life,  liberty,  and  character  of  any  person  were  under  consideration,  would  be  treated  with  in indifference.  difference. indifference.  It  was,  in  reality,  no  ground  for  guiding  decision  in  a  court  of  justice.  The  note  was  then  read  by  the  Honourable  Member  :--  have  received  your  note.  Tonyn's  business  must  remain  as  it  is.  God  bless  He  asked  after  the  perusal  of  this  note,  whether  the  language  of  it  could  be  perverted  by  any  impartial  man  into  a  charge  of  undue  influence  against  his  Royal  Highness?  He  had  no  doubt  that  Gentlemen  would  recollect,  as  a  most  important  fact,  that  when  Captain  Sandon  received  that  note,  it  was  inclosed  in  an  envelope,  the  post:nark  of  which,  was  dated  five  days  after  the  promotion  of  Capt.  Tonyn.  The  only  remaining  charge  was  that  which  had  its  rise  in  the  case  of  Samuel  Carter.  Ile  sincerely  wished,  for  the  honour  and  feelings  of  the  House,  that  the  charge  bad  not  been  brought  forward.  The  young  man,  whose  pro pro;notion  ;notion pro;notion  from  a  low  situation,  had  been  so  strongly  in insisted  sisted insisted  upon  by  those  Gentlemen  who  had  considered  it  as  the  just  ground  of  accusation  against  his  Royal  High Highness,  ness, Highness,  was  not  the  offspring  of  base  and  unworthy  parents,  but  the  offipring  of  a  veteran  Officer  who  had  of  course  such  natural  interest  in  his  welfare,  as  to  recommend  him  for  ap appointment  pointment appointment  whenever  a  vacancy  might  present  itself.  It  appeared  that  the  recommendation  had  been  made  in  1801,  three  years  before  Mrs.  Clarke  was  acquainted  or  connected  with  his  Royal  Highness.  The  name  of  Samuel  Carter  was  entered  in  the  hooks  'carding  to  the  usual  routine  and  custom,  to  be  noticed  when whenrver  rver whenrver  a  vacancy  should  occur.  A  vacancy  had  long  afterwards  occurred,  and  the  young  man  was  appointed  at  the  express  re recommendation,  commendation, recommendation,  and  in  consequence  of  the  renewed  applications  of  his  friends.  His  Royal  Highness  would,  in  reality,  ap appear  pear appear  more  entitled  to  commendation  than  censure  and  rebuke.  Air.  Burton  here  entered  into  a  series  of  general  observations  on  the  education  received  by  the  Prince  of  Wales  and  the  Duke  of  which  he  conceived  would  he  found  to  be  a  very  con considerable  siderable considerable  extenuation  of  inattention  and  imprudence,  in  the  ma management  nagement management  of  their  financial  concerns.

Of  the  usual  means  of  converting  money  into  sources  of  their  own  bene benefit  fit benefit  they  were  kept  in  complete  ignorance.  The  practical  know knowledge  ledge knowledge  was  neither  suited  to  the  views  before  them,  nor  the  dig dignified  nified dignified  and  proud  feelings  of  the  country  to  which  they  belonged.  There  was  also  a  circumstance  of  peculiar  weight  in  favour  of  his  Royal  Highness's  innocence,  Levi  that  circumstance  was  so  satisfactory,  and  carried  %vitt,  it  suc:i  impressive  conviction,  as  to  defy  the  most  minute  scrutiny,  and  to  silence  ever'  doubt.  alluded  to  the  line  of  couditet  pursued  by  his  Roval  High-  Less  is  emp;o)ing  r.  Lowten,  to  take  every  possible  pains  of  tam  i  n  io  g  into  the  system  of  living  adopted  by  Mrs.  Clarke.  Exclusively  of  the  deprivations  under  which  he  laboured  (Mr.  urtGO  has  been  long  deprived  of  sight),  he  was  rapidly  going  down  the  hill  of  life,  and  looked  to  the  other  side  of  the  grave.  In  ;it  lug  his  opinion  of  the  charges  he  could  conscientiously  eeci,ltc.  that  his  judgment  was  solely  guided  by  the  pure  princi principles  ples principles  of  jugice,  and  was  strictly  conformable  to  the  impression  which  had  been  made  upon  his  mind  by  the  testitnony  before  the  touse.

He  would  make  no  profession  of  the  purity  a  his  motives,  but  1:e  would  state,  as  a  plain  man,  the  reasons  which  would  induce  him  to  give  his  vote  contrary  to  the  Hon.

Member  sikoice  last  but  et:e  in  the  debate  (Mr,  Liurto::),  to  give  way  MARCH  19.  and  repress  his  desire.  The  speech  delivered  by  that  Gentle Gentleman  man Gentleman  was  in  every  point  of  view  as  able,  important,  and  im impressive  pressive impressive  as  any  one  ever  addressed  in  his  recollection  to  that  House.  It  was  his  intention  to  propose,  when  the  debate  was  resumed,  as  a  resolution,  Ist,  That  charges  having  been  exhibited  against  his  Royal  Highness  thy;  Duke  of  York,  of  corruption  is  the  disposal  of  army  promotions,  &amp;c.  or  corrupt  connivance  in  the  disposal  thereof,  it  is  the  bounden  duty  of  the  House  to  pronounce  a  decided  judgment  upon  those  charges.  That,  after  an  attentive  examination  of  s  itliest•es,  and  a  rigor rigorous  ous rigorous  investigation  of  documents,  there  appeared  to  the  House  no  ground  to  suspect  his  Royal  Highness  to  be  guilty  of  any  per personal  sonal personal  corruption,  or  any  personal  connivance  in  the  abuses  which  had  been  proved  to  exist  in  other  quarters.  If  these  resolutions  were  carried,  the  Right  Hon.  Oentleman  said,  he  should  then  move  an  Address  to  his  Majesty,  carrying  to  the  foot  of  the  throne  the  resolution  of  acquittal.  That  the  House  of  Commoaq,  in  consequence  of  serious  charg  es  having  been  made  against  his  Royal  Highness  the  Command  er  in  Chief,  had  gone  into  a  mi minute  nute minute  investigation  of  those  charges  and  most  distinctly  acquitted  his  Royal  Highness  of  all  knowledge  of,  or  participation  in,  any  abuses  of  military  patronage.  To  express  to  his  Majesty  the  satisfaction  they  had  derived  from  the  many  useful  regulations  which  had  been  carried  into  effect  under  the  auspices  of  the  Duke  of  York  in  the  Commander  in  Chief's  o.:tice,  and-the  high  state  of  discipline  to  which  he  had  raised  the  army  ;  but  that'at  •  the  same  time,  they  could  not  but  learn  with  concern,  that  a  connection  had  ever  been  Carried  on,  which  had  exposed  his  Royal  Highness  to  so  much  suspicion  and  obloquy,  and  that  they  learnt  with  the  sincerest  pleasure,  that  his  Royal  Highness  had  dissolved  it,  and  was  resolved  for  the  future  to  imitate  that  bright  example  of  virtue  which  his  Majesty  so  long  had  set  to  all  ranks  •of  his  people.

The  CHANCELLOR  of  the  EXCHEQUER  rose,  and  expressed  himself  nearly  as  follows  :—Sir,  from  the  tenor  of  a  part  of  Mrs.  Clarke's  evidence,  it  appeated  as  if  she  wished  it  to  be  under-.  stood  that  she  ptoeured  for  Co!.  French  the  appointment  which  he  holds  in  the  West  Indies.  But  so  far  from  this,  the  situation  he  now  holds  is  pritcisely  the  same  as  he  held  before  the  levy,  not  any  office  given  him  to  compensate  for  his  disap disappointment.  pointment. disappointment.  The  Honourable  Mover  of  these  charges  says,  that  the  levy  would  immediately  have  been  put  a  stop  to  but  for  the  influence  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  that,  owing  to  that  influence,  two  months  elapsed,  after  the  most  grievous  complaints  had  been  made  against  the  officers  employed  on  that  levy,  before  a  stop  was  pa  s  t  to  it.  But  this  was  partly  owing  to  circumstances  in incidental  cidental incidental  to  nil  the  great  public  offices,  and  partly  from  a  desire.  to  see  w  Let  her,  as  very  large  sums  of  motley  had  been  expended,  this  levy  could  not  in  the  end  be  rendered  efficient.  The  expense  of  the  men  actually  raised,  which  was  estimated  at  150/.  a  man,  wris  very  easily  accounted.  for.  The  next  case  to  which  I  call  the  attention  of  the  Douse,  is  that  of  Col.  Shaw.  Mrs.  Clarke's  evidence,  if  it  could  Le  believed,  undoubtedly  confirmed  the  statement  of  the  Ilon,:Gentleman  who  brought  forward  these  charges,  that  through  her  influence  he  had  been  put.  upon  half halfpay.  pay. halfpay.  The  letter  of  Col.  Shaw  contradicted  the  evidence  of  Mrs..  Clarke.  It  appeared  from  the  documents  presented  by  Col.  Gordon,  that  he  owed  the  appointment  to  the  zealous  inter interference  ference interference  of  General  Sir  :Harry  Isurrard,  who  was  an  old  friend  of  his  father's,  and  that  if  he  obtained  the  appointment  of  Deputy  Barrack-Master-General  at  the  Cape,  he  was  to  be  put  on  half halfpay.  pay. halfpay.  Upon  what  plea  then  can  it  be  said,  that  it  was  Mrs.  Clarke's  influence  which  procured  Col.  Shaw  to  be  pit  upon  half-pay  ?  In  regard  to  Dowlees  case,  I  may  observe,  that  it  rests  entirely  upon  the  testimony  of  Mrs.  Clarke  and  Dow  kr  himself,  and  is  unsupported  by  any  corroborating  evidence.  Whether  or  not  Mrs.  Clarke  received  a  1000/.  from  Dowier  we  have  no  means  of  knowing,  except,  from  themselves;  but  we  have  had  evidence.  enough  to  prove  that  Dow  ler  was  her  favour favourite  ite favourite  paramour.

What  is  the  consequence  of  Mrs.  Sutherland's  aresentations  - STYLE=superscript  of  Major  Turner?  An  inquiry  is  made  into  the  rcumstances  to  which  her  letter  alludes;  his  Colonel,  Lieut.  , STYLE=superscript  !n.  Cartwright,  the  proper  person  to  whom  an  application  for  ormation  in  such  a  case  is  to  be  made,  clears  his  character.  id  immediately  afterwards  his  resignation  is  accepted.  Col.  'Won's  evidence  goes  to  show,  that  had  the  letter  been  anom-  Low,  the  very  same  course  would  have  been  adopted.  From  ly  evidence  that  has  been  produced  to  substantiate  the  charge  dative  to  Samuel  Carter,  it  is  impossible  for  the  House  to  ea-  Ttain  any  other  view  of  the  case,  than  that  it  was  an  act  of  mane  and  attentive  consideration  on  the  part  of  the  Com Comalder  alder Comalder  in  Chief  towards  the  orphan  son  - STYLE=superscript  of  a  meritorious  officer,  'ho  had  lost  his  life  in  the  service  of  his  country.  But  allowing  )at  the  commission  was  granted  through  the  application  of  Mrs.  iarke,  could  any  one  . STYLE=superscript  condemn  the  Duke  fora  compliance  with  a  request  which  was  not  merely  innocent,  but  honourable  to  her  hu humnity.  mnity. humnity.  I  cannot  help  expressing  my  opinion,  whether  the  facts  'ere  so  or  no,  that  this  part  of  Mrs.  Clarke's  testimony  did  her  ere ereit  it ereit  (  Mar  !  Ilear  !  )  Yet  it  deserves  to  be  observed,  that  the  first  pplication  for  a  commission  for  Samuel  Carter  was  in  1801.  'he  application  was  not  then  acceded  to,  and  the  reason  might  probably  have  been  this,  that  a  great  reduction  was  then  taking  place  in  the  army,  and  there  were  few  commissions  to  dispose  of.  The  letters  of  the  young  man  abundantly  show  that  he  was  known  to  the  Duke  of  York.  The  paragraph  in  his  Royal  Highness's  letter  which  relates  to  General  Clavering,  Is,  Clavering  is  mistaken,  Mg  Angel,  in  thinking  that  any  new  regiments  are  to  be  raised,  only  second  battalions  to  the  existing  corps;  you  had  better  therefore  sell  him  so,  and  that  you  were  sure  there  would  be  no  use  in  applying  for  It  appears  clear  to  me  that  Mrs.  Clarke  must  have  been  playing  Waite  same  game  upon  General  Clavering,  that  she  had  been  playing  off  upon  so  .many  other  people,  and  what  the  Duke  wrote  to  her  appears  merely  to  be  in  answer  to  some  harmless  and  unimportant•  ques questions,  tions, questions,  which,  considering  the  sort  of  intimacy  that  subsisted  be between  tween between  them,  it  is  not  very  surprising  she  should  have  asked.  —  The  introduction  of  Dr.  O'Meara  to  his  Royal  highness,  who  procured  him  the  honour  to  preach  before  his  . STYLE=superscript  Majesty,  is  cer certainly  tainly certainly  a  circumstance  extremely  to  be  regretted  ;  but  it  is  -a  subject  that  has  no  relation  to  the  inquiry  now  before  the'  House.  I  cannot  help  remarking  upon  one  peculiarly  strong  feature  of  Mrs.  Clarke's  evidence,  where  she  appears  to  me  to  be  contradicted  by  the  moFt  decisive  testimony.  She  is  asked  from  time  to  time,  Was  the  Duke  of  York  privy  to  your  receiv receiving  ing receiving  money  from  officers  to  prOcure  them  promotion  To  this  She  answers--  -Yes,  I  never  concealed  any  thing  from  his  Royal  Highness.  But  how  does  this  appear  from  her  own  letters  found  in  possession  of  Captain  Huxley  Sandon  ?  There  is  an  anxiety  throughout  the  whole,  that  it  should  not  he  known  to  the  Duke  that  she  was  any  way  connected  with  Santlon;  and  this  I  can  ac account  count account  for  in  no  other  way,  than  by  supposing  she  was  afraid  lest  Otis  highness  should  discover  her  practices.  The  Right  lion.  Gentleman  then  went  into  a  minute  examination  of  the  probable  expenditure  at  Gloucester-place,  during  the  period  that  Mrs.  Clarke  was  living  there  under  the  protection  of  the  Du  ke STYLE=superscript  of STYLE=superscript  York,  and  contended,  that  the  sums  he  furnished  her  were  suf sufficient  ficient sufficient  to  cover  the  expenses  of  that  establishment,  without  there  being  any  necessity  for  Mrs.  Clarke  to  have  had-  recourse  to  cor corrupt  rupt corrupt  and  criminal  means  to  raise  supplies.  Af!er  Commenting  at  some  length  upon  the  evidence  relative  to  the  service  of  plate  purchased  of  Parker  and  Birket,  he  put  it  strongly  to  the  House,  whether  it  was.  possible  that  the  Duke  of  York,  with  the  patronage  of  preferments  to  the  amount  of  near  400,0001.  a  year  in  his  disposal,  could  have  connived  at  or  been  concerned  in  the  paltry  criminal  traffic  to  which  Mrs.  Clarke  had  so  falsely  at attached  tached attached  his  name.  The  Right  Hon.  Gentleman  next  touched  upon  the  contradictions  of  Mrs..Favery,  who  he  had  no  doubt  was  the  half-sister  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  though  that  fact  had  not  come  out  in  evidence.  «  To  oppose  the  testimony  of  such  witnesses  as  said  tite  Right  lion.  Gentleman  let  us  consider  who  are  the  persons,  with  the  exception  of  this  abandoned  woman,  who  have  enjoyed  most  of  the  confidence  of  his  Royal  Highness.  Characters  like  lien.  Calvert,  Colonel  Gordon,  and  many  others,  went  to  ,exempt  ;  his  Royal  Highness  from  every  insinuation  of  undue  and  improper  influence.  The  persons  I  have  mentioned  cannot  be  deetne  likely  to  have  sulfered  any  circumstances  and  practices  of  corruhition,  or  even  of  negligence,  to  have  passed  unnoticed  under  their  eyes.  When  I  consider  all  these  graml  and  impressive  points,  1  cannot  reconcile  myself  to  the  opinion  that  the  House  will  not  come  to  an  immediate  decision  on  the  nature  and  - STYLE=superscript  merits  of  the  charges  preferred  against  the  Duke  of  Y  ork.  t  may  therefore  pm:s  upon  t  hem  the  necessity  of  a  judgment  both  prompt  and  d.!cisive.  The  Right  lion.  Geutle Geutleman,  man, Geutleman,  after  strongly  urging  the  Bout  to  come  to  a  decided  judg judgment  ment judgment  on  the  charges,  concluded  with  toovitig  the  following  reso.  lotion,  That  charge  , STYLE=superscript  hay  ing  been  brought  against  his  Royal  Highness  the  Duke  of  York,  imputing  to  litta  personal  corrup corruptionotoi  tionotoi corruptionotoi  criminal  etninis'ance  in  his  othee  of  Commander  in  Chief  of  his  Nlajestv's  Vorces,  and  this  House  having  referred  the  said  charges  to  a  Committee  of  the  whole  I  I  ouse,  and  haying  maturely  and  carefully  investigated  the  saint-,  feel,  it  its  duty  to  pronounce  a  distinct  and  direct  opinion  upon  the  said  charges  of  personal  corruption  and  criminal  c  Mr.  BATHURST  could  not,  for  his  part,  approve  of  the  Address  moved  by  the  lion.  Gentleman  (Mr.  Wardle).  Thk!  House  had  it  it-:  its  power  to  pronounce  an  equivalent  censure  without  a  per  7  sonal  demand  of  his  Majesty,  that  he  would  be  pleased  to  dismiss  his  son  from  the  command  of  the  army.  But  if  he  haul  an  oljecti  on  to  the  lion.  Geutleman's  Address;  he  had  an  aliens'  equal  ob objection  jection objection  to  that  proposed  by  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exenequec.  The  former,  he  thought,  went  too  far  ;  the  latter  certainly  not  far  enough.  Now,  as  far  as  the  proposed  Address  merelymerelyexpre  ,, STYLE=superscript  sed  the  innocence  of  his  Bova]  highness  of  all  corrupt  partici  patimt  and  criminal  privity,  he  most  fully  concurred  in  it.  But  this  division  did  not  include  the  whole  charge  ;  he  had  originally'  (in  his  own  conception  of  it)  divided  it  into  three  points,  - STYLE=superscript  pr  distinct  heads:—  Ist,  A  participation  in  the  corrupt  dealing.  2:1.  A  knowledge  of  such  corrupt  dealing  . STYLE=superscript  .  3d.  Undue  intlueece.  There  - STYLE=superscript  were  many  Clentl,ltnen  who  were  perfectly  prepared  to  acquit  his  Royal  Ilighnes4  under  the'  two  former  points,  but  who  entertained  a  very  diifereat  opinion  on  the  latter.  Under  such  circumstances  they  could  not  vote  for  the  proposed  Address  of  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  either  because  it  might  be  supposed  to  involve  them  in  a  g,Nferal  ac acquittal,  quittal, acquittal,  or  because  it  did  not  go  far  enough.  Ile  most  sinc.rely  wished,  that  some  Gentleman  would  propose  an  Address,  which  should  unite  all  these  points,  and  thereby,  as  he  hoped,  com comprehend  prehend comprehend  all  parties.  1f  no  one  else  should  make  a  motion  to  t  his  effect,  he  should  most  certainly  deem  it  his  duty.  For  the  pre present  sent present  he  would  put  Mrs.  Clarke  and  .111  the  oral  testimony  quite  out  of  the  way,  and  attend  only  to  the  letters.  These  letters  were  in  fact,  the  least  suspicious  part  of  the  evidence.  The  hand-writing  of  all  had  been  verih..d,  and  the  g  rmter  pari  of  them  had  been  produced  by  chance,  and  without  any  jnendnility  or  concert  or  contrivance.'  Such  weii,  the  packets  produced  by  Nichols.  In  one  of  these  was  a  letter  from  his  Royal  Ilighnesi  the  Duke  of  York  to  Mrs.  Clarke,  in  which  he  Clavering  that  there  are  no  new  regiments  to  be  Now  this  certainly  proves  that  the  Duke  of  York  Was  is  the  habit  of  consulting  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  let  the  Right  Hon.  Gentle,  man  explain  it  as  he  will,  it  appears  that  his  Royal  Highness  had  no  reserve  with  Mrs.  Clarke  upon  these  sulicet  ;  ;.  And  u  hat  was  the  point  of  fact—a  man  of  family  acid  cotim.ction,  neral  Clavering,  is  so  thoroughly  persuaded  of  the  influence  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  whether  she  really  had  it  (or  not,  that  lie  oll'ere:1  her  one  thousand  pounds  to  procure  hira  a  regiment.  Here,  therefore,  one  important  point  is  established—that  the  army  had  this  opinion  of  the  influence  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  that  ttiey  acted  under  this  opinion.  He  had  examined  the  evidence  with  the  utmost  care  from  the  beginning  to  the  end,  and  *the  result  of  his  opinion  was,  that  there  was  no  evidence  w  hat=  ever  which  could  bring  home  to  the  Duke  the  guilt  of  participa participation,  tion, participation,  or  even  of  privity.  But  he  must  avow  it,  on  the  ot  4  1  hand,  as  his  most  decided  opinion,  that  there  was  the  ;nest  po.:  sitive  proof  that  the  Duke  had  bestowed  the  place:(  ments  of  his  office  anger  the  ':„uggestion  and  influence  of  Mrs.  •  Clarke,  and  therefore  the  most  improper.  The  Chancellor  ot  the  Exchequer  had  consumed  a  great  deal  of  time  in  endeavouring  to  exempt  his  Royal  Highness  from  all  blame  in  the  case  (if  Captain  Carter.  But  how  did  the  matter  stand  ?  The  letters  of  Carter  spoke  for  themselves—to  w  how  did  this  young  matt  impute  his  promotion—every  letter  teemed  with  gratitude  to  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  to  Mrs.  Clarke  alone—there  was  not  a  word  of  the  Duke  mentioned  in  them—not  a  syllable  which  would  lead  to  any  opinion  that  the  Doke  had  given  him  his  commission  as  the  son  of  Captain  Sutton.  It  was  nqiiting  to  this  view  of  the  question  whether  Samuel  Carter  was  or  was  not  alootman  of  Mrs.  Clarke;  the  only  inference  which  was  necessary  to  he  deduced  was,  that  this  young  man  had  prucured  his  commission  't  P9_TB00006 f  11 STYLE=superscript  1  •  •  •  4  1  1  •  •  P9_TB00007 1  _  throughout  the  whole,  that  it  should  not  be  Known  to  toe  LJUKC  man  explain  it  as  Ile STYLE=superscript  ww,  IL  itili  luatt STYLE=superscript  z  4,1.1.  ...,  that  she  was  any  way  connected  with  Santion;  and  this  I  can  ac  - STYLE=superscript  .1  •.,..••••  .  •  •.,  .....  •,.  had  no  reserve  with  Mrs.  Clarke  upon  these  subjects.

The  Honourable  Gentleman  then  pro proceeded  ceeded proceeded  to  state,  that  the  Resolution  which  he  shotdd  propose  to  the  HfillE''.!,  would  embrace  the  two  points  to  which  he  had  aLtuded  ie  the  course  of  his  speech;  That  in  the  room  . STYLE=superscript  of  the  examination  which  this  ;Louse  has  taken  of  the  charges  submitted  to  them  ogainst  Royal  Highness  the  Duke  of  York,  this  House  has  obsel  ved,  with  deep  regret,  that  in  consequence  of  a  connection  'mmoral  as  it  was  unbecoming,  an  interference  and  correspondence  in  vniftary  affairs  had  taken  place.  which  kns  giveu  colour  and  etlect  to  an  influence,  real  or  supposed,  most  highly  prejudicial  to  himself  and  to  the  :11r.NVIHTBRE  AD  said,  there  were  some  points,  in  the  speech  of  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  to  which  he  wished  to  state  kis  objections.  The  Right  Himourable  Gentleman  had  scouted  all  appeOl  to  the  people.  This  came  with  a  very  ill  grace  from  the  Coascellaeof  the  Exchequer—the  very  same  man  who,  in  tbe  memory  of  the  greater  part  of  that  House,  had  appealed  from  the  sense  of  Parliament  to  that  of  the  people  I  Another  Point  urged  by  the  Right  Honourable  Gentleman  was,  that  if  %ou  removed  the  Duke  of  York  there  was  no  one  to  succeed  him.  This  was  to  establish  a  principle,  as  practically  dangerous  RS  it  was  erroneous  in  principle.  But  how  was  the  matter  of  fad?  The  point  of  fact  was,  that  it  was  impossible  to  separate  this  Il Illustrious  lustrious Illustrious  Personage  from  the  family  to  which  he  belonged.  What  was  the  natural  inference  from  this?  Why,  that  it  was  wrong  in  principle  to  put  a  Prince,  so  near  the  throne,  into  any  effi efficient  cient efficient  and  responsible  station.  It  is  in  fact  impossible  that  the  :House  can  treat  the  Duke  of  York  like  any  other  individual— individualit  it individualit  is  impossible,  therefore,  that  in  this  and  in  all  similar  cases,  site  house  can  have  the  benefit  of  that  full  responsibility  which  is  the  hest  safe-guard  of  the  Constitution.  Ile  would  not  meddle  with  the  private  character  of  his  Royal  Highness,  we  had  all  faults  enough—he  would  here  pass  no,  and  leave  the  Duke  to  his  es,v  a  conscience.  The  point  before  the  House  was,  that  these  trans transu,rtions  u,rtions transu,rtions  of  his  Royal  highness  effectually  touched  the  State,  and  vreve  of  a  nature  told  description  which  in  all  aras  of  modern  histor.  had  been  the  rub'  of  nations.  This  %vas  a  subject  of  too  sough  itniw  mince  to  shut  our  eyes  upon.  In  the  earlier  part  of  Eris  speech,  the  Right  lion.  Gentleman  had  made  an  attack  on  at:  li  on.  Frictal  of  h  is.  That  Gentleman  (M  r.  Wardle)  had  conduct conduct.  . conduct.  3  hot:  -elf  with  equal  candour  and  manliness;  and  the  Country  would  lung  entertaio  a  grateful  sense  and  a  grateful  memory  of  the  services  of  that  Gentleman.  The.  Chancellor  of  the  Ex  che chegoeriliad  goeriliad chegoeriliad  sneered  likewise  at  the  manner  in  which  the  resolutinas  had  been  fronted,  and  had  suggested,  that  cooler  heads  than  the  lion.  Gentleman's  had  been  employed  in  drawing  them  up.  He  could  not  misunderstand  this  allusion,  which  was  evidently  in intended  tended intended  for  him.  He  had  indeed  known  the  Honourable  Gentleman  (Mr.  Wardle)  in  very  early  life,  but  they  had  been  separated  by  the  different  course  of  their  *waiver  yeats,  and  he  believed  that,  till  the  present  Session,  he  had  not  seen  him  for  twenty  years.  fin  the  beginnin;  of  the  Session,  the  Honourable  Gentleman  had  certainly  informed  him,  that  he  had  such  charges  tit  bring  against  the  Duke  of  York.  To  this  he  had  replied,  by  advising  him  most  earnestly  to  think  of  what  lie  was  about,  and  suggested  to  him,  from  his  own  experience,  the  heavy  loss  of  sine,  the  an  iety  b  3  night  and  by  day,  which  must  necessarily  attend  on  undertnkings  of  this  nature.  Ile  (Mr.  Whitbread)  had  then  pledged  himself,  that  he  would  most  certainly  attend  in  his  seat  en  the  motion,  and  3,  - STYLE=superscript  out/i  second  him  in  Motion.  From  that  time  to  the  present.  he  had  only  seen  accide!naily  in  the  street.  He  had  no  hesitation  to  say,  tin  it  gasais  decided  opinion  that  his  Royal  Highness  the  Dui  e  of  York  was  guilty  of  a  direct  pri-ity.  He  did  not  think  that  he  had  participated  in  any  money,  but  be  eras  clearly  of  opinion  that  he  knew  that  'ovary  had  hen  ta!;ert,  ;:ad  therefore  that  he  was  guilty  of  a  corrupt  privity.  His  Honourable  Friend  had  pursued  that  line  of  conduct  from  his  own  mind,  which  if  he  had  done  him  (Mr.  Whitbread)  the  honour  to  consult  him,  he  should  corrainly  Lave  ised  him.  lie  had  tampered  justice  with  the  cOnsider:ition  which  was  due  to  the  feelings  of  a  father.—He  ;tad  co!,•  :•Ilt.i.rt  at  once  what  the  interests  of  the  Country  required,  and  what  the  Wow  . STYLE=superscript  t  - STYLE=superscript  ,,t);:  of  the  Accused,  and  the  exalted  stature  of  his  connectin  seemed  to  suggest.  Under  this  impression,  he  certainly  not  be  backward  in  his  own  duty.  It  might  give  him  pain,  but  he  would  discharge  it  to  the  utmost.  The  House  stood  in  on  awful  situation  before  the  conntrv,  and  though  the  Right  lionaorable  Gentleman  opposite  f  Mr.  Perceval),  might  deem  it  prudent  to  scout  the  opinion  of  tt.e  Puhlie,  he  for  one  thatight  it  his  duty  to  show  some  respect  for  his  coosti  tows,  tt4ave  some  deference  for  public  opinion.

Clarke  is  not  to  be  believed  from  the  'rause  of  her  life  ;  if  these  classes  of  women  a  ere  to  he  discredited  merely  irate  their  up upfortunate  fortunate upfortunate  situation,  it  would  be  hard  indeed.  It  is  '•••,  because  one  has  been  guilty  of  misconduct,  that  therefore  the  whole  class  is  to  be  coudemned  ;  if  this  were  to  he  the  -Ise,  w:.at  would  become  of  the  captains,  after  the  conduct  of  Capta:a  Huxley  Sandon  ;  and  what  would  become  of  the  generela  after  the  conduct  of  General  Clavering,  who  certainly  had  done  no  credit  to  any  class  of  society  ?  The  conduct  of  that  unfortunate  class  to  which  Mrs.  Clarke  was  stated  to  helang,  though  sometimes  erroneous,  did  not  disqualify  them  from  telling  the  truth  ;  nor  is  there  one  of  them,  though  they  had  forfeited  their  virtue,  whose  evidence  would  not  be  sufficient  to  co::  ict  any  man  of  perjury  in  a  court  of  justice.  The  Hon.  Gentlenans  had  also  endeavoured  to  stigmatize  the  charaeter  of  the  woman,  in  stating  that  she  was  all  along  actuated  in  her  conduct  by  ma malice  lice malice  and  revenge.  It  was  certainly  not  very  unnatural  to  sttp,  pose  after  the  treatment  she  had  met  with  from  the  Duke  of  York,  who  had  discarded  and  ill-ased  her,  end  pecu pecuniary  niary pecuniary  transactions  did  not  act  in  a  way  most  cred:  tp.h:s;  ta  him himself,  self, himself,  that  she  would  take  the  first  opportunity  at  retaliating.  His  Honourable  Friend  had  certainly  argatai  vary  reason reasonably  ably reasonably  on  the  separation.  The  Honourable  Gent!  luau  hacj  stated  that  she  had  made  a  claim,  through  Mr.  A  ,!  - STYLE=superscript  La.,  :o  the  Duke  of  York,  for  her  pension,  and  that  she  said,  if  di  i  yen  Ley  necessity,  she  mast  have  recourse  to  this  which  she  stated  to  he  as  unpleasant  to  her  as  to  the  I)uk..  of  . STYLE=superscript  *::ork.  It  must  be  confessed  that  the  provocation  aas  k:it,  but  in  the  course  of  conversation  with  many  persons,  it  wasnatural  to  suppose,  she  would  mention  her  grievance,  and  it  would  course  be  retailed  from  month  to  mouth,  and  it  would  at  length  he  conveyed  back  to  the  ears  of  his  tto'  al  Highness.  And  it  wos  not  at  all  improbable,  that  there  were  many  persons  who,  on  being  informed  that  she  was  in  possession  of  some  letters  of  the  Duke  of  York  would  have  been  ready  to  advance  her  I  MO!.  for  the  pur purchase  chase purchase  of  them,  and  her  reccasi:ies  tseuld  have  hcea  Er  a  lieved.  It  did  not  appear,  however,  that  she  had  heen  (.o  de determined  termined determined  in  her  plan  of  vengeance.  It  was  well  Llama  that  when  she  lived  at  Hampstead,  that  instead  of  conce•  tiog  any  plan  of  revenge,  she  burnt  innumerable  letters  from  the  Duke  to  herself,  and  sent  down  others  to  Nicholls,  in  order  to  light  his  tire  ;  from  this  it  did  not  appear  that  she  had  laid  a  very  dos!)  plan  of  revenge.  lie  was  ready  to  allow,  that  when  she  ap appeared  peared appeared  at  the  Bar  of  the  House,  she  had  evinced  a  considerable  degree  of  ability,  of  flippancy,  of  spirit,  of  elfronter)  . STYLE=superscript  .,  and  of  impudence;  )et  when  she  was  examined  for  three  whole  hours  by  the  Solicitor  and  Attorney  Generals,  ;:he  Wiled  them  all,  and  gave  her  testimony  in  a  clear  and  con connected  nected connected  style,  although  she  was  treated  with  a  g.-cater  de degree  gree degree  of  roughness,  and  was  shown  less  indulgence  than  any  other  witness  who  had  been  examined.  It  came  out  that  she  had  had  transactions  with  Gen.  Claverin  and  Dr.  o':,leara.  When  Gen.  Clavering  had  written  a  letter  to  the  Attorney  Gene General,  ral, General,  desiring  to  he  called  to  the  Bar  as  an  evidence  to  impeach  the  testimony  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  he  should  at  least  have  conic  with  clean  hands  ;  hut  in  order  to  prove  Mrs.  Clarke's  falsehood,  he  ce:'erred  to  her  own  evidence  with  respect  to  himself,  and  denied  th.it  he  had  ever  applied  to  her  for  any  military  command,  Th::  t  she  should  mention  the  name  of  Dr.  O'Meara,  a  protestant  elergyman,  as  a  person  for  whom  she  was  to  use  her  influence.  aas  considered  by  the  Right  Hon.  Gentleman  as  a  libel  not  to  be  credited,  and  as  a  sufficient  ground  for  discharging,  the  wit witness  ness witness  from  the  bar  as  unworthy.  Fortunately,  however,  for  the  establishment  of  her  assertion,  Gen.  Claveriig  came  to  the  bar,,  and  those  letters,  uf  the  existence  of  which  she  knew  nothing,  acre  produced,  and  the  letters  which  had  been  given  by  her  to  Nichols  to  be  destroyed  were  brought  forward.  Amongst  them  was  a  letter  from  Gen.  Clavering.  in  his  own  hand-writing,  which  proved  in  characters,  black  as  Erchns,  the  falsehood  of  hisassertion  and  the  vanity  of  his  attempt  to  invalidate  the  testi testimony  mony testimony  of  NI  rs.  Clarke.  There  was  also  a  letter  frop  the  Arch Archbishop  bishop Archbishop  of  Tuam,  recommending  Dr.  O'Meara  to  the  notice  of  his  Royal  Highness,*  and  requesting  her  to  use  her  influence  in  the  furtherance  of  his  objects  ;  if  she  had  made  that  state statement  ment statement  in  her  evidence,  it  would  not  have  been  believed.  —The  Right  Honourable  Gentleman  stated  in  his  speech,  that  the  validity  of  'Airs.  Clarke's  evidence  was  impeached  in  twenty-eight  different  instances.  But  by  whom  was  the  first  charge  supported  ?  By  Nicholls,  who  had  already  proved  him himself  self himself  the  basest  character,  but  whose  testimony  was  of  course  un unimpeachable,  impeachable, unimpeachable,  because  it  came  in  favour  of  the  Duke  of  York.  It  appeared  that  Mrs.  Clarke  applied  to  Nicholls  several  times  for  her  letters,  which  he  as  repeatedly  refused  to  deliver  to  her,  and  would  nut  even  let  her  peruse  them  ;  and  afterwards,  when  P10_TB00006 P10_TB00007 P, ",0002644/1809//0312/0002644_18090312_mets.xml

In  the  ease  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  it  was  hut  World  for  her,  on  procurito  , STYLE=superscript  the  hang-writing  of  General  Clayecing,  which  she  had  imagined  was  destroyed,  to  smile,  when  she  felt  that  that  writing  was  to  clear  her  character  front  the  imputation  of  falsehood  cast  on  it  by  the  testimony  of  that  gentleman.  lle  watched  her  counte countenance,  nance, countenance,  hut  saw  no  other  expression.

This  assertion  was  disproved  by  whom?  Hy  Nichols,  who  had  proved,  by  the  baseness  of  his  conduct,  in  retaining  in  his  possession  the  letter  entrusted  to  him  to  destroy,  that  he  was  himself  unworthy  of  belief,  as  it  was  evident  his  object  for  keeping  them  was  to  extort  money  from  Mrs.  Clarke  hereafter,  by  threatening  to  poblish  them.  It  was  of  little  or  no  importance;  for  if  we  looked  hack  to  our  own  youthful  days,  we  should  probably  recol recollect  lect recollect  that  we  had  stiled  the  partner  for  the  night  our  wife,  who  was  in  fact  no  wife  at  afl  ;  and  that,  in  the  course  of  Our  amusement,  we  have  gone  h  names  foreign  from  our  real  and  actual  titles.  The  assertion,  Whether  true  or  false,  was  immaterial  ;  and  if  it  was  in  a  case  of  life  and  death,  he  de dedared  dared dedared  to  God  it  would  not  in  his  mind  invalidate  the  testimony  of  the  Witness.  At  the  court-martial  she  was  also  described  as  a  widow,  and  %vas  examined  as  such,  ilia  was  not  asked  a  ques question  tion question  on  the  subject,  consequently  there  was  no  conduct  of  her's  on  that  occasion  that  could  warrant  a  charge  of  falsehood.  Of  the  twenty-seven  remaining  cases,  the  Right  Min.  Gentleman  had  not  been  able  to  prove  any  one.  The  lion.

STYLE=superscript  the  man  to  throw  the  broad  shield  of  flattery  and,  servility  over  any  corrupt  practices  in  public  men,  .it  is  my  avowed  opinion  that  such  corrupt  practic  e STYLE=superscript  s  in STYLE=superscript  such STYLE=superscript  men STYLE=superscript  ::.hould  be  branded  «ith  greater  infamy  in  proportion  to  their  greater  mischiefs.  I  can  never,  therefore,  allow  that  the  rank  of  the  ()Wender,  be  it  ever  so  exalted,  should  screen  him  personally  from  the  ptmishment  and  infamy  which  should  avail  his  criminal  acts.  In  this  point  of  view,  rVery  one  must  be  sensible  that  his  Royal  nighties-.  !  . STYLE=superscript  root  his  princely  rank  and  connection  ., STYLE=superscript  ,  could  not  stand  he!'4lre  that  tiowe  as  an  individual_  It  would,  in  a  degr  , STYLE=superscript  '('  at  le;1  1 STYLE=superscript  ,  atrcet  the  public  estimation,  and  the  public  re,:reet  for  Vie  reigning  family  ;  and  in  these  time:,  nothing  WO  , STYLE=superscript  !  , STYLE=superscript  0  he  dreaded  as  this  diminution  front  the  respect  due  to  sot.ereign  how-  es,  through  all  their  branches.  1,  for  one,  therefore,  Sir,  heard  this  Inquiry  proposed  with  reluctance,  and  saw  it  proceed  in  the  form  and  manner  in  w  hich  it  has  proceeded,  with  the  most  profound  regret.  Circumstances,  however,  have  now  changed  ;  the  matter  has  been  brought  forward,  and  having  been  so  pro produced,  duced, produced,  it  now  becomes  a  paramount  duty  with  tin'  House,  to  discharge  the  part  which  belong:to  it.  Under  these  impression:,  I  shall  not  deem  it  necessary  to  qualify  my  sentiments,  and  ,hall  therefore  proceed  to  give  any  opinion  on  the  caw,  as  it  171  stands,  on  its  own  merits.  The  Honourable.  Gentleman  by  my  bide  (Mr.  Bathurst)  very  property  suggested  to  the  House,  in  the  debate  of  last  night,  that  the  Address,  as  propieied  by  the  Chau,  cellor  of  the  Exchequer,  iecluded  (tidy  two  members  of  the  ge general  neral general  charge,  that  is  to  say,  personal  corruption  and  criminal  connivance.  My  Honourable  Ft  ietel  e  cry  justly  added,  that  there  was  a  third  point,  he  bay  ing  granted  away  the  places  aid  appointments  of  his  °dice,  under  undue  infhwece.  My  Hon.  Friend  stated,  at  the  same  time,  that  this  undue  influence  was  as  directly  pernicion:  to  the  spirit  aed  character  of  the  a;  my,  as  ever  the  alleged  personal  corruption  and  commercial  connivance.

There  is  still  another  point,  a  fourth  point,  to  w  hich  I  must  call  the  attention  of  the  House,  as  to  my  mind,  and  to  that  of  many  of  my  Honourable  Friends,  it  has  very  considerable  weight  ;  1  mean  the  offence  against  puhlic  morals,  in  the  scandalous  and  unbectening  con connection  nection connection  acknowledged  by  his  Royal  Highness.  Whatever  ell'ect ell'ected  ed ell'ected  the  State,  either  directly  or  censequentially,  was  within  the  province  of  that  'louse,  and  no  one  w  ill,  1  hope,  deny,  that  this  open  adulterous  connection  had  been  without  Some  detriment  to  the  official  dischar:re  of  the  ditties  of  the  Commander  in  Chief.  ith  this  view  of  the  subject,  therefore,  1  intend  to  conclude  my  Motion  with  an  Address  sti  framed  as  may  include  all  these  point..  and  thus  enable  the  House  to  Cool('  lo  a  decision,  w  be bether  ther bether  his  Royal  Highness  ha  been  guilty  of  such  personal  cor corruption,  ruption, corruption,  such  criminal  connivance,  end  of  havine  acted  tinder  such  undue  influence.  These  will  be  the  main  points  of  wnat  have  to  propose.  1  come  now  to  say  a  few  v.  tads  on  the  case  itself.  There  appears  to  me  to  be  Oa  ee  or  fintr  ponds  in  the  es  i idence  dence idence  which  bring  it  home  to  his  Royal  II  ighness  ;  the  Ist  is,  ilia  Taylor.

To  in,  mind  they  have  all  the  characters  of  truth,  all  the  little  circumstances  wlt  ich  ,  in  questions  of  this  nature,  speak  more  powerfully  than  volumes.  ll'  Miss  Taylor  l  a  id  beets  a  conspirator  witii  Yl  Es.

The  twat  circumstance  which  certainly  brings  the  matter  home  to  leas  Royal  Highness,  is,  the  in\  sterioas  note,  as  it  had  been  called,  but  a  note  on  w  Inc  It  no  one,  I.  believe  call  now  entertain  any  doubt.  If  the  note  had  been  a  foreery,  it  tv  mei  have  been  more  direct,  more  completely  to  the  purpose.  It.  would  have  left  nothing  to  doubt.

It  would  hecome  the  House  of  Commons  of  Great  Britain  to  avoid  failing  the  dupes  of  a  popular  cry,  (Bear!  hear!)  and  by  discarding  from  their  consideration  the  merits  of  so  faithful  :trervant  to  the  Public,  commit  an  act  of  injustice  as  undeserved  sis  it  was  unnecessary.  Lord  Fo  eteseom  6,  in  a  speech  of  considerable  length  and  energy,  expressed  his  intention  to  support  the  original  Motion,  proposed  by  Mr.  Wardle.  It  had  been  endeavoured,  by  several  l  Hon.

It  is  not  our  intention  at  present  to  comment  on  the  De Debates  bates Debates  in  the  House  of  Commons,  they  speak  sufficently  for  themselves  they  appeal  vehemently  to  the  feelings  of  every  man,  who  takes  an  interest  in  the  tranquillity  and  honour  of  his  country.  We  have  given  it  as  our  invaria invariable  ble invariable  opinion,  that  the  Commons  would  act,  in  this  unpre unprecedented  cedented unprecedented  business,  with  a  dignity  and  independence,  which  will  convince  the  world,  that  their  duty  as  Representatives  of  the  British  Nation,  is  paramount  to  every  other  consi consideration.  deration. consideration.  So  far  from  perceiving  as  yet  any  reason  to  vary  in  this  opinion,  we  solemnly  declare  that  we  believe  that  no  confront,  were  it  even  incautiously  attempted,  would  his:o  their  decision  in  this  momentous  business.  The  Public,  in  this  great  crisis,  look  up  with  painfJl  anxiety  to  their  Representatives.  Their  decision  will  have  an  effect  on  the  future  happiness  of  the  nation  ,  which  it  would  be  almost  hazardous  to  calculate.  We  will  venture  no  opinion  on  the  delinquency,  or  innocence  of  the  ac accused;  cused; accused;  but  he  has  unquestionably  given  proofs  of  weakness,  folly  and  immorality,  which  disqualify  him,  in  the  opinion  of  many,  for  the  important  office  he  now  fills.  The  eyes  of  all  Europe  are  fixed  on  this  investigation.  The  enemy  attend  to  the  proceedings  with  the  most  malicious  cxul cxultation.  tation. cxultation.  They  comment  on  the  gross  abuses,  which  have  been  discovered  during  the  proceedings;  and  their  com comments  ments comments  have  suffused  our  cheeks  with  blushes,  and  filled  our  heart  with  sorrow  and  indignation.  But  we  trust  the  termination  of  this  business  will  make  their  triumph  a  short  lived  one.  It  is  only  our  baseness  which  can  gratify  them  ;  our  servility  afford  them  pleasure.  It  is  said  that  the  accused  manifests  a  sovereign  indiffer indifference  ence indifference  for  the  incanlious  comments  of  the  Public,  and  walks  about  the  streets  of  the  metropolis,  with  a  confidence  and  ease,  which  are  frequently  the  companions  of  conscious  .  innocence,  and  as  often  the  attributes  of  a  character  which  sets  praise  and  blame,  surmises  and  insinuation,  at  defiance.  e  cannot  say,  on  the  occasion,  that  we  envy  him  his  feelings,  but  we  cannot  but  admire  the  consistency  of  cha•  racter  he  maintains  till  the  last.

One  of  them,  The  Journal  de  L'Empire,  the  least  respectable  even  of  the  Paris  papers  for  the  authen authenticity  ticity authenticity  of  its  reports,  contains  an  undicial  account  of  the  fall  of  Saragossa.  This  event  it  states  to  have  taken  place  on  the  21st  January.  But  this  statement,  it  is  plain,  is  given  for  the  purpose  of  palliating  the  severe  reverses  which  the  French  have  sustained  in  another  part  of  the  Peninsula.  It  is  couched  in  all  the  extravagance  and  hyperbole  of  fiction,  and  evidently  intended  to  astonish  and  divert  the  higher  and  lower  rabble  of  the  capital.  A  part  of  the  account,  however,  we  are  willing  to  credit,  as  it  coincides  with  the  previous  intelligence  we  had  relative  to  the  bril brilliant  liant brilliant  success  of  PALA  FOX.  It  mentions  that  the  troops,  Un Under  der Under  the  command  of  that  truly  Illustrious  bad  made  a  sortie,  and  advanced  a  considerable  distance  from  the  walls,  but  were  driven  back  ;  and  on  the  French  following  up  the  success,  they  received  a  Deputation  from  the  City,  proposing  to  surrender  it,  on  condition  that  the  lives  of  the  Citizens  should  be  spared.  This  was  peremp peremptorily  torily peremptorily  ref  used  E  used  by  LANS,  who  commanded  the  blockade.  On  this  refusal  the  inhabitants  are  represented  to  have  pro proceeded  ceeded proceeded  to  the  altars,  and  solemnly  pledged  themselves  to  bury  themselves  under  the  ruins  of  their  city,  rather  than  surrender,  They  then  repaired  to  their  respective  posts  of  defence.  The  French  rushed  through  the  gates  of  the  city,  without  much  resistance,  when  a  mine  was  suddenly  sprung,  prepared  for  the  purpose,  which  made  a  tremendous  havoc  among  the  assailants.  So  far.  the  facts  have  some  resem resemblance  blance resemblance  with  the  previous  accounts  received  by  the  way  of  Spain,  and  which  our  Readers  will  have  seen  in  a  former  paper.  This  article  concludes  with  asserting  that  Saragossa  afterwards  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  enemy  ;  aid  that  LANWES  proposed  a  general.  pardon  to  such  of  the  inhabi inhabitants  tants inhabitants  as  would  submit  to  the  new  Government.  To  invalidate  the  authenticity  of  this  statement,  it  is  only  necessary  to  advert  that  not  one  of  the  other  Paris  Fivers  refers  to  this  event.  We  are  positively  informed  that  the  Moniteur  of  the  same  date  does  not  allude  to  it.  A  circumstance  of  such  vast  importance,  which  the  French  papers  unanimously  consider  as  decisive  of  06  submission  of  the  Peninsula,  would  not  fail  to  be  mentioned  with  a  mi minuteness  nuteness minuteness  of  detail,  a  copiousness  of  fact,  which  disinguish  similar  reports  on  the  part  of  the  enemy.  .  Not  a  word  is  mentioned  relative  to  PALAFOX,  the  very  man  whose  cap capture  ture capture  would  be  as  gratifying  to  the.tyrant,  as  the  fall  of  Sa Saragossa  ragossa Saragossa  itself.  That  Hero  has  too  much  signalized  himself  by  his  resistance  and  enmity  to  the  invaders  of  his  country,  as  not  to  excite  among  the  French  some  degree  of  interest  relative  to  his  fate.  This  silence  is,  in  our  opinion,  conclu conclusive,  sive, conclusive,  and  serves  to  prove  that  this  is  one  of  those  fabri fabrications,  cations, fabrications,  which  the  plotting,  wily  despot  resorts  to,  in  order  to  appease  the  public  mind  in  France,  intimi intimidate  date intimidate  Austria,  fix  the  wavering  allegiance  of  his  Ger German  man German  vassals,  and  impose  upon  the  courts  of  Berlin  and  Petersburgh.  This  trick  is  imperiously  urgent  in  the  present  crisis  of  Europe  ;  and  what  is  public  opinion  to  the  wretch,  whose  misdeeds  have  long  placed  beyond  him  the  reach  of  that  tribunal.  He  is  conscious  that  he  now  governs.by  terror;  and  as  long  as  he  is  able  to  keep  that  sensation,  in  its  present  extent  and  vigour,  alive,  he  attaches  very  little  importance  to  the  attachment  of  his  Slaves.  The  whole  population  of  France,  his  armies,  his  vassal  states,  must  now  be  sensible  to  the  precariousness  of  the  tenure,  by  which.they  hold  their  lives  and  repose.  Those,  among  them  most  remarkable  for  moral  and  intellectual  stupidity,  must  begin  to  murmur  at  the  accumulating  misery  of  the  Kaman  race.  Not  a  momentary  respite  is  granted  ;  but  ivar  succeeds  war,  devastation  follows  on  devastation  ;  and  to  what  and  to  whom  are  these  horrors  to  be  traced  ?  To  a  foreign  adventurer,  whose  origin,  whose  primitive  ob obscurity,  scurity, obscurity,  whose  early  dependence  and  obscurity  in  their  own  country,  they  are  now  filly  acquainted  with.  This  report  of  the  fall  of  Saragossa,  we  are  inclined  to  believe  strongly,  was  intended  Tor  some  of  the  purposes  ,  173  above  stated,  as  well  as  to  palliate  a  signal  reverse  sus sustamed  tamed sustamed  by  the  enemy  in  Cataloma.  We  were  prepared,  in  some  measure,  for  this  important  occurrence,  by  the  late*  arrivals  from  Spain.  They  stated  that  General  REDING,.  who  was  at  the  head  of  25,000  excellent  troops,  was  pre preparing  paring preparing  to  act  on  the  olleasive.  This  account  is  fully  corroborated  by  a  splendid  victory,  which  that  distin— distinguished  guished distinguished  officer  gained  over  Si'.  CYR,  who  commands  the  6  enemy  in  that  province.  He  afterwards  obtained  possession►  of  the  citadel  and  town  of  Barcelona,  in  the  neighbourhood  of  which  this  splendid  action  took  place.  It  must  be  re remarked,  marked, remarked,  that  the  French  Papers  contain  some  allusious  to  this  circumstance,  the  particulars  of  which  we  have  collected  from  private  accounts.  The  force  of  Sr.  Ca  it  salts  staled  two  months  ago,  when  he  raised  the  siege  of  Barcelona,  to  have  amounted  to  40,000  men  ;  and  this  soperiority  of  force  induced  Rcauva  to  retire  from  the  neighhdurhood  that  city.

The  idea  of  a  new  Continental  war,  was,  therefore,  regarded  as  the  delirious  dream  of  a  feverish  visionary,  as  the.  wild  fancy  of  an  over-heated  fanatic.  —But  our  conjectures  rested  on  the  immutable  laws  of  human  feelings,  whi.  h  act  with  equal  force,  allowing  some  trifling  differences  for  peculiar  institutions,  on  the  Danube,  the  Spree,  the  Scheldt,  the  Ebro,  and  the  Thames.  The  nations  of  the  Continent  were  lost  in  a  momentary  trance,  is  consequence  of  the  dreadful,  the  'unexpected  reverses  they  had  sustained  ;  and  as  long  as  this  paroxism  lasted  they  were  insensible  to  the  accumulating  outrages  which  were  inflicted  on  them.

Great  abuses,  and  grosser  -errors,  incidental  to  human  affairs,  have  prevented  the  complete  Sevelepement  of  the  national  energy  ;  and  pre prejudices  judices prejudices  cadmic:lay  and  overweening  confidence,  the  unfor unforinmate  inmate unforinmate  inheritance  of  States,  as  well  as  individuals,  have  occasioned  the  recent  misfortunes  of  that  power.

The  genius  of  the  Archduke  Charles,  seconded  by  the  efforts  and  wishes  of  the  enlightened  and  patriotic,  has  succeeded  in  introducing  a  reform,  which  has  extended  to  the  minutest  branch  of  the  military  department;  and  the  Army  has  not  only  increased  in  physical,  but  also  in  moral,  strength.

The  castle  of  Trinidad,  situated  on  an  eminence  but  commanded  by  heights,  was  also  invested  ;  three  twenty-four-pounders  battered  in  breach,  to  which  a  fourth  was  afterwards  added,  and  a  passage  through  the  wall  to  ihe  lower  bomb-proof  being  nearly  effected,  on  the  2.1  d  the  marines  of  the  Fatue  were  withdrawn.

THE  11-IL:1'1'11E.  lIAY-ALIRKET.  After  a  long  interval,  during  which  some  of  our  best  plays  have  been  performed,  the  Managers  of  Covent  Garden  Company  have  at  length  made  an  attempt  at  novelty  in  a  new  Comedy,  which  was  produced  at  this  Theatre  on  Thursday  evening  called  '  Independence.  or  the  Trustee.'  with  respect  to  plot,  the  comedy  before  us  possesses  so  little,  that  any  person  may  foresee  at  the  beginning  what  will  he  the  conrlusio'i  of  the  play.

MARCH  12.  ELOPEMENT.  Lady  Charlotte  Wellesley's  elopement  with  Lord  Paget  is  the  theme  of  general  conversation  in  the  West-end  of  the  town.  Her  Ladyship  arose  at  the  usual  hour  on  Monday,  and  after  passing  some  time,  according  to  her  custom,  with  her  infant  family,  iu  the  nursery,  she  left  it  for  the  breakfast-room,  iv  here  she  break breakfasted  fasted breakfasted  alone;  Mr.  U.  *Wellesley,  her  husband,  being  confined  to  his  room  by  indisposition.  Shortly  after  she  ordered  a  foot footman  man footman  to  attend  her  to  the  Green  Park,  having  a  wish,  as  she  said,  to  take  a  walk.  She  left  him  at  the  gate,  with  di directions  rections directions  to  return  for  her  in  an  hour.  During  this  interval,  Mr.  11.  Wellesley  had  left  his  room,  and  inquired  for  her.  A  servant  was  sent  to  the  Green  Park  to  look  for  her,  Wit  all  search  there  and  every  where  else  proved  ineffectual.  When  Lady  Charlotte  left  the  house,  her  agitation  Wf.S  so  great  as  to  be  apparent  to  all  the  domestics  ;  the  butler  particularly  ob observed,  served, observed,  that  •in  the  hurried  manner  in  which  she  prepared  to  lease  the  house,  she  had  put  on  her  cloak  with  the  wrong  side  out,  The  footman  who  attended  her  also  observed  much  agitas  tion  in  her  manner,  while,  with  a  hurried  step,  she  was  pro  ceeding  to  the  Green  Park.  It  had  been  also  customary  with  her  to  take  her  eldest  child  for  her  companion,  in  her  morning  walk.  The  little  fellow  earnestly  desired  the  usual  indul indulgence,  gence, indulgence,  but  she  refused,  and  he  was  left  behind:  Mr.  Wellesley  sent  his  children  to  the  house  of  his  brother,  at  Chelsea.  On  the  same  evening,  Lady  Emily  Wellesley,  her  sister,  came  to  his  house  in  Curzon-street  ;  and  having  received  from  her  mo mother  ther mother  the  keys  of  her  sister's  drawers,  carried  off  part  of  their  contents  in  three  bundles,  without  having  seen  Mr.  H.  Welles.;  ley.  As  soon  as  he  was  informed  of  this  circumstance,  he  se secured  cured secured  the  remaining  articles;  and  observed,  that  Lady  Emily  must  explain  this  circumstance  hereafter.  It  also  appears  from  the  statement  of  the  domestics  who  attended  upon  her  out  of  doors,  that  she  had  ordered,  within  the  last  ten  days,  consi considerable  derable considerable  quantities  of  dresses  of  various  kinds,  at  the  same  time  desiring  the  trades-people  not  to  send  them  to  her  house,  but  to  keep  them  until  she  should  send  for  them.  Lord  Paget,  according  to  various  statements,  accompanied  the  Expedition  to  Spain  chiefly  in  order  to  disembarrass  himself  from  the  affection  which  he  secretly  cheribhed  for  Lady  C.  Wel Wellesley.  lesley. Wellesley.  Absence  is  perhaps  the  worst  expedient  to  which  lovers  can  resort.  The  moment  Lord  P.  returned,  the  flame  for  some  time  repressed,  broke  out  in  him  with  redoubled  violence,  and  produced  the  catastrophe  now  deplored  by  the  relations  on  both  sides.  It  was  .  rumoured,  we  should  observe,  that  a  duel,  at attended  tended attended  with  lamentable  consequences,  had  taken  effect  between  Lord  P.  and  Sir  A.  W.  ;  but,  in  the  absence  of  better  accounts,  we  do  not  think,  from  the  attendance  of  the  latter  in  his  senato senato-4'riai  4'riai senato-4'riai STYLE=superscript  capacity;  that  any  credit  is  attached  to  such  report•  .  ,  M/IRDER.—A  barbarous  murder  was  committed  ou  Thursday  evening,  on  the  body  of  Miss  Fourner  , STYLE=superscript  an  am  ia STYLE=superscript  b  le STYLE=superscript  y  oun STYLE=superscript  g  lad STYLE=superscript  y  twenty:four  years  of  ago,  the  daughter  of  an  opulent  farmer  at  Chepstowe,  Wilts.  Miss  Fourner  had  received  the  addresses  of  a  young  man  of  the  name  of  Fawke,  for  the  last  two  years,  but  in  consequence  of  some  disagreement  the  inatth  was  broke  off,  and  the  young  lady  gained  another  suitor.  She  had  been  on  a  visit  at  a  hisuse  half  a  mile  from  her  residence,  on  Thursday  evening,  and  on  returning  home  with  her  male  friend,  at  tea  o'clock  on  the  night  stated,  they  were  attacked  by  two  persons,  one  of  whoisi  knocked  the  man  down  with  a  bludgeon,  and  the  other  hurried  off  Miss  F.  from  the  spot.  She  was  found  dead  in  the  same  field  in  an  hour  after  this  transaction,  cut  in  different  harts  of  the  head  and  body.  Fawke  has  not  been  since  seen  at  the  village  of  Chi  pstowe,  where  he  also  resided;  and  there  are  strong  proofs  of  his  having  been  the  pe...etrator  of  the  horrid  murder.
