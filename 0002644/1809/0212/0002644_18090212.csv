The  supposition  is  so  moostrousoo  revolting,  that  we  feel  a  glow  of  indignation  in  making  it.  The  same  repugnance  is  common  to  all  nations  ;  and  however  great  the  defl.cts  of  their  government  may  be,  their  antipathy  to  the  yoke  of  a  foreigner,  imposed  at  the  point  of  the  bayonet,  is  inextinguishable.  As  soon  as  we  assent  to  the  foregoing  facts,  our  futiqw  policy  is  obvious.  If  it  be  adhered  to,  the  subjugation  oidipailh  is  im impossible.  possible. impossible.  Should  the  tyrant  even  plant  his  Eagles  WR  the  towers:  of  Lisbon,  and  on  the  walls  of  Cadiz,  Saragossa,  Seville,  and  Valencia,  his  sovereignty  over  the  country  is  as  precarious  as  it  had  been  six  months  ago.  Ilowe‘er,  if  our  Government  has  a  tparticle  of  energy  left,  this  calamity  may  he  averted.  .But  the  misconduct  and  weakness  of  Ministers  have  been  so  very  glaring,  .that  we  are  afraid  of  recommending  measures  more  consonant  to  our  wishes  and  the  resources  of  the  empire.  As  we  despair  of  - STYLE=superscript  great  or  edicacious  exertions  on  their  part,  we  will  confine  ourselves  to  a  line  of  policy  more  conformable  to  their  capacity  and  the  conduct  they  have  hitherto  pursued.  A  Bun  Let  OH  or  a  CHATH  Am,  we  know  full  well,  would  manage  our  affairs  in  a  different  manner;  and  under  the  guidance  of  their  genius,  eighty  thousand  British  soldier;,  at  the  foot  of  the  Sierra  Morena,  would  give  BONAPA  RTC  some  occupation,  and  force  him  to  fitht  many  a  hard  blttle,  before  he  should  be  able  to  plant  his  Eagles  on  a  village  steeple  to  the  south  of  those  mountains.  But  our  modern  statesmen  arc  not  of  that  fighting  disposition;  and  with  an  army  of  two  hundred  and  twenty  thousand  of  the  hest  soldiers  in  the  universe,  and  the  immen  , STYLE=superscript  e  sum  of  seventy  millions  sterling  at  their  disposal,  they  vaunt  their  services  and  energy,  for  having  sent  a  sixth  part  of  our  force,  when  the  battle  of  Spain  was  almost  over,  to  contend  against  the  undivided  str.ngth  of  the  enemy.  We  will  not  touch  longer  on  that  grating  string;  and  as  their  exertions  appear  to  be  confined  to  that  unanspicions  trial  of  their  energy,  we  ill  now  consider  what  ought  to  be  done,  should  Bo  NA  PA  ttzu  succeed  iu  overrunning  the  Southern  departments  Though  Ministers  may  feel  a  disinclination  to  give  us  another  specimen  of  their  energy  and  foresight,  by  sending  another  army  directly  to  Spain,  we  trust  their  efforts  win  not  be  confined  to  the  late  ill-fated  expedition.  They  may  not  be  very  splendid  tacticians,  nor  possess  much  topographical  knowledge,  either  in  a  military,  or  any  other  view  ;  but  they  will  not  have  the  courage  to  appear  before  the  bar  of  their  country,  and  say,  we  have  made  a  proper  use  of  its  resources  and  confidence,  and  have  performed  every  thing  which  could  he  done  to  assist  the  Spaniards  effectually.  They  promise  and  bluster  much,  it  is  true;  and  formidable  expeditions  are  every  day  orderc,l  to  sail  for  Cadiz,  or  some  other  port  in  the  South.  There  are  few  instances  of  braggarts;  who  perform  much  ;  and  if  serious  wishes  were  entertained  to  make  a  diversion  in  favour  of  the  `:paniards  of  the  South,  we  really  fear  that  our  expedition  may  arrive,  at  the  very  montent  Bo  N.IPA  KT  had  succeeded  in  dis  persing  the  last  army  of  the  l'atri  , STYLE=superscript  it  s.

They  cannot  complain  of  scarcity  of  shipping.  Flying  squadrons  should  therefore  be  immediately  detached  to  the  coat-ts  of  the  Atlantic  aryl  MelPterrancan,  with  stores,  arms,  soldiers,  and  xnoney.

0005,"PRINCE  OF  WALES.  IT  is  pretty  generally  known,  that  his  Royal  Highness  George  Augustus  Frederick,  Prince  of  Wales,  was  born  on  the  twelfth  of  August  1762;  a  memorable  and,  perhaps,  remarkable  day— dayas  as dayas  the  anniversary  of  the  Accession  of  the  House  of  Brunswick  to  the  British  Throne.  lle  is  now,  therefore,  in  his  forty fortyseventh  seventh fortyseventh  year.  Many  difficulties  attend  the  delineation  of  the  characters  of  exalted  personages.  Such  characters  are  variously  estimated,  because,  conspicuously  as  they  seem  to  be  exhibited,.  they  are  often  very  imperfectly  understood.  It  is  in  this  predicament  that  we  arc  still  compelled  to  contemplate  the  heir-apparent  to  the  throne  of  our  country.  What  he  might  have  proved,  had  it  been  permitted  him,  about  the  year  1788,  to  take  an  efficient  part  in  the  ;2;overnment  of  this  tuition,  it  were  useless  now  to  imagine;  but  it  must  be  confessed,  as  it  ought  to  be  remem remembered,  bered, remembered,  that  the  present  Prince  of  Wales  has  not,  since  the  me-  Laichol  y  period  just  noticed,  met  v  its  any  opportunity  for  acting,  up  to  those  public  principles  which  lie  is  believed  to  have  cherished,  or  for  displaying  those  abilities  of  which  he  is  known  to  be  possessed.  His  laudable  spirit  of  emulation  has  been  checked,  and  repressed  ;  his  hopes  have  bees  excited,  only  to  he  disappointed  ;  and  his  patriotic  endeavours,  to  assume  the  station  becoming  his  rank  in  society,  have  only  subjected  him  to  mortifying  repulses,  and  an  absolute  veto  upon  his  most  digni dignified  fied dignified  proposal.  The  second  person  in  the  kingdom,  hint  to  whom  the  expectations  of  the  people  were  directed,  and  who  panted  for  nothing  so  much  as  to  justify  the  fund  opinion  en entertained  tertained entertained  of  him  by  his  countrymen,  he,  and  be  only,  seems  to  have  been  necessitated  to  make  his  amusements  his  occupation,  and  to  shrowd  himself  under  an  obscurity  with  which  he  is  gusted.

If  any  corroboration  were  re  quired  as  to  this  trait  in  the  disposition  of  his  Royal  Highness,  it•was  to  be  seen  when  . STYLE=superscript  he  attended  the  embarkation  of  his  regi regiment,  ment, regiment,  for  Spain:  in  his  unaffected  declaration  of  his  own  wil willingness  lingness willingness  to  have  accompanied  them,  in  the  affectionate  enthusiasm  with  which  he  was  then  cheered  by  his  soldiery  . STYLE=superscript  ,  and  in  the  gallantry  with  which  they  afterwards  conducted  themselves.  One  of  the  privates,  in  this  regiment,  captured  Lefebvre.  While  the  merits  of  the  Prince  of  Wales  are  attempted  to  be  ascertained,  it  will  be  expected  that  some  allusion  should  he  made  to  what  are  considered  as  his  demerits.  Liberal  and  in ingenuous,  genuous, ingenuous,  but  with  resources  by  no  means  answerable  to  the  splendid  situation  he  was  destined  to  fill,  is  it  to  be  wondered  at,  when  reviewing  the  career  of  this  Prince,  that  we  find  him  early  incurring  pecuniary  difficulties;  and  frankly  applying,  to  the  proper  quarter,  for  assistance  I  The  income  of  his  Royal  Highness  .

Every  one  regrets  the  differences  existing  between  this  Prince  and  his  'Lova  Consort.  They  were  married,  with  uncommon  magnificence,  at  St.  James's  Palace,  on  the  Bth  of  April  1795  ;  *which  union  produced,  on  the  7th  of  January  1796,  the  young  Princess  Charlotte.

He  is  purely  English.  He  is  rerfectly  acquainted  with  our  political  institutions  ;  and  has,  on  more  than  one  occasion,  solemnly  de declared  clared declared  his  unfeigned  respect  for  the  principles  to  which  he  owes  his  own  illustrious  elevation.  He  has  so  long  mixed  with  those  whose  scepter  he  is  expected  to  sway,  and  is  so  personally  known  among  the  elevated  circles  of  society  in  this  kingdom,  that  whenever  hi.;  Royal  Highness,  in  the  course  of  human  af affairs,  fairs, affairs,  shall  ascend  the  throne  of  his  august  ancestors,  the  nobi nobility  lity nobility  of  ,this  country  will  surround  him  as  one  family  ;  while  the  commonest  of  the  people  must  feel,  from  the  experience  he  has  auquired  in  their  transactions  and  concernments,  that  in  this  Prince,  however  removed  from  them  by  necessary  distinctions,  they  will  have  every  thing  to  hope  from  the  proper  combina combination  tion combination  of  humanity  with  royalty.  Disadvantages  sometimes  pro produce  duce produce  advantages.  If  this  Prince  knows  the  people,  he  owes  this  knowledge,  which  is  to  him  of  inestimable  value,  to  the  political  inactivity  to  which  he  has  been  so  long  restricted.  .

From  the  confidential  intereonrse  that  had  existed  between  her  and  a  high  personage,  I  thought  there  must  have  been  many  unreserved  communications  between  them,  in  certain  moments  ;  and  that  to  introduce  matters  of  this  sort  must  excite  his  resentment,  and  that  whatever  promises  of  protection  might  he  made  to  her,  she  might  not  be  protected  from  that  re resentment.s--Q.  sentment.s--Q. resentment.s--Q.

A  Lady  then  entered  the  room,  who  called  herself  Miss  Farquhar  ;  I  presented  the  note  to  her,  and  she  owned  it  was  her  Writing,  but  she  told.  me  she  would  communicate  nothing  but  on  a  personal  interview  with  the  Royal  Personage.  I  told  her  that  was  impossible,  unless  she  would  give  me  same  clue  to  conduct  me  to  the  nature  of  the  business.  She  then  introduced  a  conversation  tending  to  produce  blood  he het%ven  t%ven het%ven  tWo  Illustrious  Persons.  I  am  certain  that  the  House  rt  ill  not  permit  me  to  state  the  particulars,  hut  the  substance  Has,  that  the  greatest  enmity  subsisted  between  them,  which  1  am  quite  certain  is  unfounded  calumny.  1  told  her  so,  and  ex expressed,my  pressed,my expressed,my  entire  disbelief  of  what  she  had  said.

I  then  left  her,  telling  her  I  would  would  inform  his  Royal  lligline-s  of  w  hat  she  had  said  ;  I  did  so,  and  his  Royal  Highness  observed,  that  the  woman's  conduct  was  so  abominable,  he  would  have  nothing  to  say  her.  Mr.  C.  LONG  wished  to  say  a  few  W:;1%15.  Mrs.  Clarke  had  stated,  that  hi  Royal  Highness  the  Duke  of  York  had  told  beg  that  he  had  recommended  Mr.  Dowler  to  me  to  be  appointed  Assistant  Commis-ary,  and  that  I  had  acreed  that  it  shoull  he  settled  immediately.  To  the  best  of  my  recollection,  his  Itnal  Highness  never  mentioned  his  name  to  me,  and  I  never  saw  hint  till  he  camelto  the  Ear  of  this  llothe.

This  document  has  no  date,  but  it  was  received  in  March,  1804.  The  answer  was  dated  the  1511;  of  March,  1804.  (Cul.  Gordon  read  the  answer,  which  stated,  that  Major  Toilyn's  name  had  been  noted  for  promot  too,  and  that  his  Royal  llighues  would  Hot  forget  him  when  a  favourable  opportunity  occurred.)  These  are  all  the  official  documents  that  1  have  found  with  re respect  spect respect  to  Major  Tonyn.  In  August  1804,  a  large  augmentation  of  the  army  took  place,  to  the  amount  of  50  additional  battalions.  In  the  fornation  of  these,  I  received  the  orders  of  the  Caen Caeninand;r  inand;r Caeninand;r  in STYLE=superscript  Chief  to  prepare  a  list  of  the  senior  officers  of  the  army  generally,  of  each  rank,  and  to  take  the  names  from  the  book  of  recommenOations  where  they  had  been  entered.  1  did  so,  and  in  that  list  with  Capt.  Tonyn  appeared  53  Officers  to  be  appointed  to  Majorities;  I  L  Majors.  removed  from  other  regi.  'limits  or  from  half-pay;  13  Brevet-Majors  ;  and  29  Captains;  of  the  last,  7  were  of  the  year  1794,  9  of  the  year  1795  (ainong  whom  was  Capt.  Tenyol,  5  of  the  year  1798,  7  of  the  year  1797,  and  one  of  the  year  1799.  Q.  By  Mr.  YORKE—Can  Colonel  Gordon  state  what  is  the  average  of  the  purchase  money  in  each  year?  A.  The  average  of  the  last  three  years  considerably  exceeds  400,000/.  a  year.—  Q.  Can  Colonel  Gordon  account  for  the  origin  of  irchases  and  pu,  -  sales  of  cotnroissiow,  and  will  he  state  the  effect  that  in  his  opt-  nion  they  have  on•the  army  ?  A.  The  origin  was  as  follows  :  in  every  other  service  in  Europe  the  person  at  the  head  of  the  army  has  the  power  of  granting  pensions,  according  to  service.  No  such  power  is  enjoyed  by  the  Commander  in  Chief  here.  When  the  colonel  of  a  regiment  is  rendered,  by  age  or  incapable  of  accompanying  his  regiment  into  service.  His  Ma Majesty  jesty Majesty  cannot  increase  the  establishment  of  the  regiment,  by  mak making  ing making  another  colonel  ;  it  would  he  unjust  to  put  the  old  or  wounded  officer  on  half-pay,  or  deprive  him  of  his  commission.  No  alternative  remains,  but  allow  him  to  retire  on  a  compensa•  tion.  What  that  compensation  should  be  was  *maned  by  Board  of  General  Officers  in  1765.  They  awarded  certain  sums  to  be  received  by  officers  thus  retiring  from  service;  Kh  ios  sums  are  called  the  regulation  prices  of  commissions.  As  to  tht  bearing  of  this  system  on  the  army,  that  is  very  extensive.  Q.  Does  Col.  Gordon  recollect  the  Commander  in  Chief  ever  having  taken  out  of  his  pocket,  a  list  of  officers,  and  given  it  is  him  with  an  intimation  that  they  must  be  promoted  out  of  the  regular  course  ?  A.  I  never  recollect  such  an  instance.  I  mast  take  this  opportouity  to  say  that  I  never  recollect  a  solitary  ins instance  tance instance  in  which  the  Commander  in  Chief  hat-  put  SRC!'  a  paper  into  my  hands.  All  recommendations  have  proceeded  through  their  proper  channel,  without  asitagleexception.  Colonel  Gordon  was  then  ordered  to  withdraw.

IL  onba  il  l  SUNDAY,  FEBRUARY  12,  1809.  POLITIC4L  EVENTS  OF  THE  WEEK.  We  received  yesterday  Lisbon  Papers  to  the  29tfi  ultimo.  Their  contents  arc  interesting.  The  retreat  of  the  British  and  Spanish  armies  was  known  there;  'and  an  invasion  from  the  French  was  consequently  expected  ;  but  the  inhabitants  appear  to  be  animated  with  a  firm  resolu resolution  tion resolution  to  oppose  the  most  vigorous  resistance.  AU  the  pro provinces  vinces provinces  were  arming  for  that  purpose;  and  the  enthusiasm  of  the  inhabitants  was  so  great,  that  the  single  province  of  Beisa  had  already  collected  an  armed  force  of  more  than  70,000  men:  viz.  30,975  fusiieers  ;  39,803  pikemen,  and  118  cavalry.  The  fortified  places  on  the  frontiers  were  put  in  a  respectable  state  of  defence,  and  were  amply  sup supplied  plied supplied  with  warlike  stores  and  provisions.  This  generoul  resolution  of  defending  their  country  is  not  confined  to  any  particular  district;  but  appears  to  be  adopted  by  the  whole  nation.  The  cities  of  Oporto  and  Lisbon  give  a  praise praiseworthy  worthy praiseworthy  example  to  the  rest  of  the  kingdom,  and  every  effort  was  made  to  render  the  positions  in  the  neighbour neighbourhood  hood neighbourhood  of  the  capital  as  formidable  as  possible;  for  which  purpose  70  pieces  of  cannon  had  been  taken  from  the  arsenal,  to  be  mounted  on  the  most  important  points  of  defence.  No  mention  is  made  of  the  British  fume  under  Sir  JoaN  CRADDOCK  ;  but  we  trust  our  troops  will  not  abandon  the  country  as  long  as  the  Portuguese  manifest  a  resolution  of  defending  themselves.  -;  •  1  The  Regency  have  published  a  most  animated  proclama proclamation  tion proclamation  addressed  to  the  Portuguese  people.  They  do  not  conceal  the  dangers  to  which  the  .  country  is  exposed,  nor  the  talents,  vigour,  and  rapidity  of  the  enemy.  This  spi spirited  rited spirited  appeal  to  the  feelings  and  honour  of  the  nation  Thus  concludes:—Portuguese  be  soldiers,  repulse  the  Satei Satei•'  •' Satei•'  lites  of  the  tyrant,  who,  in  common  with  the  tyg-er,  can  never  be  satiated  with  blood  and  courage.

It  is  a  mortifying-  reflection  for  self-love,  that  experience  is  to  be  acquired  by  most  men  only  from  misfortunes  and  reverses  ;  had  it  been  instinctive,  the  principal  efforts  of  the  Spanish  and  British  Governmetts  had  bees  directed  in  the  commencement  of  the  contest,  to  or organise  ganise organise  in  the  Southern  Provinces  those  great  means  of  resist resistance,  ance, resistance,  which  the  nature  of  the  country,  and  the  enthusiasm  of  the  natives  so  amply  offered.  No  contest  ever  began  under  such  favourable  auspices,  and  never  were  hopes  so  cruelly  slisappointed.  A  dreadful  responsibility  attaches  some somewhere.  where. somewhere.  We  acquit  the  majority  of  the  two  countries,  without  any  hesitation,  of  having  frustrated,  by  their  stpathy,  the  noblest  prospect  of  safety  to  Europe,  and  freedom  to  mankind,  that  has  presented  itself  for  a  series  a  years.

The  sermon  also  is  deserving  of  very  general  attention  ;  and  the  BISHOP  Of  CARLISLE,  on  the  whole,  certainly  made  *an  impression  highly  creditable  to  his  own  talents,  as  well  as  beneficial  to  his  numerous  hearers.  The  Bishop's  text,  which  was  peculiarly  appropriate,  is  recorded  in  the  Book  qf  the  Prophet  Isaiah;  and  may  he  found  in  the  '26th  Chapter,  and  at  the  9th  Verse,  of  bit  Prophecy.—Wilh  my  soul  have  I  desired  Thee  in  the-night:  yea,  with  my  spirit  within  me  will  I  seed':  Thee  early:  for  when  thy  judgments  are  in  the  earth,  the  inhabitants  of  the  world  will  learn  righteousness.  Notwithstanding  the  opinion  already  expressed  of  the  ability  of  the  new  Bishop  of  Carlisle,  he  must  allow  me  to  dissent  from  him  respecting  the  propriety,  or  even  the  ne necessity,  cessity, necessity,  of  his  critical  explanation  of  part  of  the  text  which  formed  the  subject  of  his  excellent  discourse.  Whether  Nye  read,  with  the  Vulgate,  when  thy  .  &amp;c.  or,  AS  his  Lordship  would  render  it,  amirding  or,  in  proportion  speaking  of  the  Almighty,  ‘,  thy  judg judgments  ments judgments  are  abroad  in  the  &amp;c.  the  distinction,  it  ap appears  pears appears  to  me,  is  by  no  means  essential  to  the  full  and  true  application  of  this  passage  of  Holy  'Writ.  Such  expesitory  discussions,  indeed,.  if  not  really  beneficial,  are  serioudy  detrimental.  Either  let  review  and  revise  the  common  bible  altogether,  or  eke  !Lt.  us  IC:igious4  refrain  from  !es-  FEB.  le.  sealing  its  authority  with  the  mass  of  the  people.  Is  not  the  authority  of  our  Common  Bible  impeached,  and  its  in influence  fluence influence  affected,  by  every  unnecessary  a:tempt  to  explain  its  supposed  diffiebilties,  and  correct  its  imagined  inaccura inaccuracies  cies inaccuracies  ?  His  Lordship's  exordium  was  otherwise  highly  in instructive  structive instructive  and  interesting.  The  division  of  his  subject  was  perfectly  judicious,  and  his  illustrations  were  strikingly  apposite.  His  sermon  very  properly  referred,  immediately  and  principally,  to  the  situation  of  this  country.  He  did  not  attempt  to  discuss  the  nature  of  fast-days.  With  a  precision  always  admirable,  and  an  energy  often  commanding,  he  traced,  from  the  cradle  of  philoscphical  infidelity,  the  growth  of  that  demon  which,  hiv.ing  first  tinder tinderth..!  th..! tinderth..!  moral  supports  of  society,  has  produced  the  subversion  of  legitimate  supremacy,  and  the  conse consequent  quent consequent  desolation  of  empires  and  countries.  His  allusion  to  the  great  Frederick  of  Prussia,  together  with  his  exempli exemplification,  fication, exemplification,  in  the  ruin  of  that  power,  of  the  effects  resulting  from  the  countenance  afforded  to  infidel  principles,  was  as  just  as  it  was  forcible.  if  any  part  of  the  picture  seemed  to  be  incongruous,  it  was  where  th.;  Bishop  found  it  incumbent:  on  him  to  introduce  the  corruption  and  degeneracy  of  the  highest  orders  of  civilized  cornmunitles.  Here,  I  think,  he  rather  softened  his  general  colouring.  It  well  became  the  Bishop  of  Carlisle,  as  a  christian  preacher,  to  insist,  in  the  manner  he  did,  on  the  folly  and  danger  and  impiety,  now  so  growingly  prevalent,  of  almost  excluding  the  Divine  Creator  from  interfering  in  the  con concerns  cerns concerns  of  his  human  creatures.  How  deplorable  is  such  a  persuasion,  when,  as  the  Bishop  of  Carlisle  too  truly  ob observed,  served, observed,  there  is  a  Power  raised  for  the  scourging  and  afflicting  of  the  nations  ;  and  when,  as  to  ourselves,  We  have  now  no  Ally,  if  we  have  not  God  We,  how however,  ever, however,  seem  sadly  disposed  to  discard  the  assistance  of  the  Di Divine  vine Divine  Providence  ;  and  this,  too,  at  the  precise  period  when  mast  we  need  its  interposition  and  protection  !  Happy,  happy,  most  llappy,  the  man,  who  secs  1  God  employed  In  all  the  good  and  ill  that  ehecquers  life  !  Resolving  all  events,  with  their  effects,  And  manifold  re‘ults,  into  the  will  And  arbitration  wise  of  the  Supreme.  The  Task.  Really,  it  is  vain,  and  worse  than  vain,  to  boast  of  hu human  man human  genius,  or  prowess,  as  alone  able  to  give  chit-ability  to  earthly  power.  Why  (as  the  Bishop  demanded)  if  the  continuance  of  human  authority  depends  wholly  on  the  exercise  of  human  ability,  have  so  many  powerful  dynast.  ties,  in  various  epochs  of  the  world,  rose  and  fell,  without  one  of  them  attaining  to  any  thin:;  resembling  perpetuity  ?  And  how  comes  it,  we  might  add,  that  of  those,  succes successively  sively successively  distinguished  from  among  their  several  contempora contemporaries,  ries, contemporaries,  who  alter  and  decide,  humaniv  s;:eaking,  the  desti destinies  nies destinies  cif  communities—how  happens  it  that,  of  such  cha characters,  racters, characters,  one  age  is  more  prolific  than  another  ;  and  that,  in  many  instances,  such  characters  appear  only  in  certain  ages,  and  in  particular  countries  ?  While  we  cannot  dispute  the  effect  of  this  dispensation,  we  persist,  nevertheless,  in  wilfully  resisting  the  cause.  I  was  much  gratified  to  find  the  Bishop  of  Carlisle  en entirely  tirely entirely  consistent.  Taught  of  Jesus  Christ,  as  well  as  disci disciplined  plined disciplined  by  he  insisted,  wi!li  much  earnestness  and  devotion,  on  the  important  doctrine  of  the  divine  atone atonement.  ment. atonement.  He  disdained  to  halt  between  orthodoxy  and  theo theoloLty;  loLty; theoloLty;  resting  his  hope  of  eternal  salvation,  directly  and  absolutely,  on  his  acceptance  through  the  merits  of  his  heavenly  mediator  and  redeemer  !  Let  us  look  for  some  good  from  this  episcopal  example.  Aly  present  limits  preclude  me  from  following  the  Bishop  of  Carlisle  through  other  topics;  or,  I  should  gladly  avail  myself  of  this  occasion  to  discuss,  with  him,  the  necessity  of  erecting  places  of  worship  for  the  agreeable,  yet  gra gratuitous,  tuitous, gratuitous,  accommodation  of  the  people.  The  measure  is  entitled  to  consideration.  I  shall  perhaps  venture,  at  a  more  convenient  opportunity,  to  suggest  some  observa  tioes  respecting  it.

On  Monday  night  Mr.  Wright,  from  the  Edinburgh  Theatre,  pupil  of  the  celeorated  Mr.  hough,  made  his  second  appearance  at  Drury-Lane,  in  the  part  of  Cato.  This  tragedy  . STYLE=superscript  possesses  few'  claims  to  admirltion,  as  an  acting  play.  It  is  full  of  declamatory,  not  natural  sentiments,  and  events  highly  improbable  and  in  some  instances  almost  ludicrous.  Among  the  latter,  may  he  pointed  out  the  disguise  of  Sempranins,  who  assumes  the  attire  of  the  umidian  Prince  Juba,  without  assuming  his  tawny  complexion,  anti  yet  though  most  unlike  that  young  warrior,  deceives  his  gnards  and  his  mistress.  The  ri ridicule  dicule ridicule  of  this  character,  was  felt  by  the  whole  house,  for  when  Sc►apro►►ills  falls  by  the  sword  of  Juba,  and  in  the  agonies  of  rage  exclaimed,  grow  distracted,  - STYLE=superscript  a  general  laugh  at  tended  with  hisses  burst  from  every  part.

THE  UNCONSCIOUS  COUNTERFEIT.  On  Thursday  last,  a  new  farce,  in  two  acts,  entitled,  The  Un Unconscious  conscious Unconscious  was  produced  at  Drury  Lane.  The  plot  of  this  after-piece  hears  so  much  resemblance  to  that  of  Is  he  s STYLE=superscript  Prince,  that  we  strongly  suspect  both  'have  sprung  from  the  same  pen.  The  mistake  vs  Welt  gives  birth  to  the  whole  action,  prore•Nls  from  a  letter  instead  of  a  picture.  The  scene  is  in  Wales  instead  of  Cermanv  ;  but  the  characters  are  nearly  ens.  in  the  sante  mould.  We  find  in  it  a  good-natured,  open-heartedt  and  credulous  Welch  srinire,  a  dashing  captain,  who  however  rims  away  from  his  creditors,  instead  like  Captain  Llndorf,  of  travelling  to  see  his  love  , STYLE=superscript  a  timid STYLE=superscript  and STYLE=superscript  romantic STYLE=superscript  swain,  who  finishes  by  marrying  the  •younz  lady,  and  an  old  usurer,  who  in  he  othor  farce,  is  replaced  by  a  rich  banker.
