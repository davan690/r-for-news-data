There  is  not  a  courtier,  a  placeinan,  or  an  ex-prince,  who  once  ,  rioted  in  the  corruption  which  overturned  the  thrones  oi  the  BOURBONS,  that  has  not  shed  many  an  unavailing  tear  at  the  folly  and  extravagance  of  his  former  conduct.  They  were  reminded  of  the  volcano  on  which  they  were  dancing,  singing,  feasting  with  their  parasites  and  mistresses;  but  they  laughed  at  the  absurdity  of  the  advice,  and  thought  Bicetre  a  fit  mansion  for  such  an  extravagant  wight  ;  or  corn cornplained  plained cornplained  of  the  licentiousness  of  the  press,  got  the  adviser  immured  in  the  dungeons  of  the  bastile.

We  did  exult  sincerely  and  ardently  in  the  investigation,  and  '  we  bestowed  our  most  unqualified  approbation  on  !tir.Wsit-  DLE  for  his  patriotism,  courage,  and  constitutional  indepen independence.  dence. independence.

The  accused  - STYLE=superscript  has  been  acquited,  and  we  bow  with  due  de deference  ference deference  to  the  decision;  but  when  we  reflect  on  the  number  of  respectable  Members  who  voted  for  Mr.  'WARDLE'S  ori original  ginal original  motion,  we  think  we  have havecause  cause havecause  to  congratulate  the  country,  that  it  possesses  124  individuals  in  the  list  of  its  Representatives  who  consider  its  interest  as  paramount  to  every  other  obligation.  Even  this  circumstance,  impor importaut  taut importaut  and  consolatory  as  it  is,  we  regard  as  a  secondary  con consideration,  sideration, consideration,  when  compared  with  the  salutary  impression  !  which  the  precedent  leaves  on  the  minds  of  the  public.  There  is  no  character  so  exalted  in  rank,  but  may  be  brought  to  trial  on  charges  of  misdemeanours;  and  this  advantage  should  outweigh,  even  in  the  opinion  of  the  alarmists,  any  inconvenience  which  the  I):-hi  or  YoaK  may  have  suffered  '  in  consequence  of  the  pznlicity  of  his  amours.  We  would  advise  them,  however,  not  to  let  the  idea  prey  too  much  on  1  their  feelings,  as  if  his  Ro!.11  Highness  sliffered  very  poig poignantly  nantly poignantly  from  the  disclosure  ;  for  we  are  very  much  mistaken  is  that  Illustrious  Personage,  if  he  k  not  as  completely  in indifferent  different indifferent  to  their  sympathy  as  he  is  to  our  strictures.  The  great  fault  in  his  character  is  not  excessive  delicacy  :  his  contempt  of  Mrs.  Clarke's  menaces,  his  conscientious  in indifference  difference indifference  to  the  claims  of  a  female  who,  for  four  years  was  the  object  of  his  dearest  atlections,  the  centre  of  all  his  happiness,  his  solace  amidst  the  anxiety  and  embarrass embarrassments  ments embarrassments  of  his  arduous  office,  leave  little  doubt  of  the  stoicism  of  his  princely  mind.  There  is  no  observation  so  supremely  true  as—that  no nothing  thing nothing  is  so  dangerous  as  an  imbecile  friend.  The  DUKE,  of  YORK  must  have  felt  the  full  force  of  this  remark  ;  for  his  pretended  advocates,  from  an  intemperate  wish  to  displzay  their  zeal  in  his  behalf;  have  represented  him  as  one  of  the  weakest,  silliest,  and  most  culpable  men  on  the  surface  .)f  our  globe.  Their  defence  reminds  us  of  the  bear  in  the  fabie,  and  his  au  kward,  clumsy  zeal  for  his  sleeping  friend..

To  be  convinced  of  an  impartial  decision  on  the  part  of  that  illustrious  body,  we  will  go  back  to  the  period  of  the  second  Punic  War;  and  consider  the  e:der  AFRICANUS  as  the  party  accused.  The  choice  is  rather  auk  ward,  we  acknowledge  ;  for  our  Readers  will  probably  recollect  au  adventure  of  that  hero  whilst  he  commanded  in  Spain,  which,  whatever  similarity  there  may  be  in  military  talents,  raises  some  doubt  whether  the  two  commanders  were  equally  sensible  to  the  fascinating  powers  of  beauty.  But  we  will  not  press  the  speculation  too  far  ;  and  will  confine  ourselves  to  the  observation,  that  if  this  supposed  occur occurrence  rence occurrence  had  taken  place,  even  on  the  anniverary  of  the  battle  of  Zama,  the  order  of  the  illustrious  Roman  to  his  Judges  to  follow  him  to  the  capitol,  in  order  to  return  thanks  to  the  Gods  for  that  memorable  event,  would  not  have  been  so  implicitly  obeyed.  We  will  now  close  our  strictures  on  this  subject  for  ever.  They  have  caused  us  some  paiu,  and  we  never  undertook  a  task  with  greater  reluctance.  But  every  motive,  which  could  influence  the  citizen  and  the  man,  forced  us  to  pur pursue  sue pursue  the  path  we  have  taken.  Great  energy  and  great  courage  are  requisite  in  the  pre present  sent present  crisis;  and  the  tendency  of  our  age,  in  direct  contra contradiction  diction contradiction  to  a  flippant  assertion  of  Mr.  CANNING  and  his  friends,  is  rather  to  flatter,  than  to  defame,  men  vested  with  power.  But  in  the  hour  of  danger,  should  it  ever  arrive,  it  will  be  then  seen  that  the  persons  who  arc  now  branded  wit  h  the  epithet  of  Jacobins,  will  display  as  much  ardour  in  the  defence  of  their  country,  and  perhaps  more,  than  those  very  mon  who  are  now  in  the  possession  of  its  highest  honours.  It  is  the  most  revolting  insolence,  as  well  as  the  most  danger dangerous  ous dangerous  abuse  of  authority,  to  accuse  individuals,  who  benefit  the  state  by  their  labours  and  talents,  of  disaffectionsto  the  establishment  ;  because  they  are  too  independent,  or  too  honest  to  bestow  indiscriminate  approbation  on  every  act  of  a  Minister.  The  impartiality  of  their  censnre  is  the  test  of  their  disinterestedness,  for  the  road  to  ministerial  favour  is  neither  freedom  of  judgment  nor  an  avowed  abhorrence  of  corruption.  But  there  is  a  reward  far  above  the  smile  of  a  Court  and  the  patronage  of  a  Minister;  and  that  re recompence  compence recompence  every  man  may  find  in  the  applause  of  his  own  conscience.  There  is,  besides,  in  some  bosoms  a  consum consuming  ing consuming  love  of  freedom,  an  intense  hatred  of  corruption  ;  their  loyalty  is  not  fashioned  nor  calculated  according  to  the  profits  it  may  produce;  they  love  their  country  pas passionately,  sionately, passionately,  and  detest  such  as  dishonour  it.

In  either  of  these  cases,  the  House  must  he  satisfied  that  she  ought  not  to  haye  had  that  influence  at  all.  ni  first,  as  to  the  case  of  Brook  and  Knight,  in  which  lie  pointed  out  a  ma material  terial material  contradiction  between  the  evidence  of  Mr.  Robert  K  night,  and  Mrs.  Clarke,  with  respect  to  t  he  slip  of  paper.  The  next  point  was  the  consideration  of  French's  Levy.  .A;111  here  he  noticed  a  material  difference  in  the  evidence  of  Miss  Taylor  and  Mrs.  Clarke.

To  he  sure,  it  chewed  that  some  intercourse  must  have  taken  place  between  his  Royal  Highness  and  Mrs.  Clarke,  but  there  was  not  the  least  reason  to  suppose  from  the  , STYLE=superscript  contents  of  that  note,  that  any  corrupt  practices  were  to  he  im imputed  puted imputed  to  his  Royal  Highness  the  Duke  of  York.  The  next  case  was  that  of  Colonel  Shaw,  but  it  would  be  recollected  that  this  Gentleman  owed  his  promotion  to  the  good  offices  or  Sir  if.

It  is  not  likely  that  a  person  tt  ho  bad  beer,  proved  to  he  in  the  habits  of  such  close  intimacy  with  Mrs.  Clarke,  should  have  advanced  10W.  In  every  instance  of  corruption  the  House  should  be  perfectly  satisfied  that  a  successful  termination  had  been  put  to  the  alleged  acts.

Whether  dr.).  should  come  to  any  definite  opinion  as  to  t  he  personal  guilt  of  the  Duke;  and  if  they  did,  what  that  opinion  should  be,  and  how  worded.  He  then  observed  upon  a  variety  of  modes  Or  forms  by  which  they  might  deride.  The  House  had  not  called  for  the  test  of  evidence  which  all  ages  had  adopted—the  test  of  oath.  in  examinations,  there  was  generally  something  left  to  surmise;  hut  Mrs.  Clarke's  evidence  came  home  to  the  Duke;  there  was  nothing  to  suggest.  She  told  the  House  that  his  Royal  Highness  authorised  anti  approved  of  all  she  had  done  ;  that  he  encouraged  her;  and  that  in  fact  he  made  her  the  mere  instrument  of  his  extortions.  Anti  he  could  not  but  express  his  surprise  to  find  the  Addresl  so  worded,  as  not  to  rely  on  the  evidence  of  Mrs.  It  is  There  was  no  necessity  for  them  to  know  that  her  evidence  was  untrue;  it  was  if  they  had  reasonable  doubts.  They  ought  not  have  a  witness  tinder  the  influence  of  malice;  and  as  to  Mr  , STYLE=superscript  .  yarke's  evidence,  on  the  w  hole,  many  gentlemen  were  of  opi.•  mon  that  it  ought  to  be  set  aside;  but  he  thought  the:  re  were  gome  parts  that  seemed  to  have  some  truth.  It  had  been  proved  toat  she  had  had  some  influence  over  the  mind  of  the  Duke.  As  to  Mi:.s  Taylor's  evidence,  it  went  to  confirm  the  corruption  of  the  Duke.  There  certain!  v  was  nothing  - STYLE=superscript  to  impeach  her  CA  idence,  but  it  had  struck  him  as  rather  extraordinary,  that  her  memory  siiould  be  so  correct  as  to  wl:at  had  passed  four  or  live  years  since,  and  that  it  should  -o  fail  her  as  to  what  had  occurred  a  few  days  before  her  examination.

The  Honourable  aml  Learned  Gentleman  then  pro proceeded  ceeded proceeded  to  point  out  in  what  respect  the  evidence  of  Mrs.  Clarke  was  such  that  it  did  not  deserve  credence..  'I  he  first  observation  AV  Well  occurred  to  him  on  her  evidence  was,  OW  she  did  not  commence  this  traffic  until  her  distress  began.  In  this  assertion  she  was  directly  contradicted  by  the  ease  of  Colonel  French's  levy,  the  negotiation  of  which  it  appeared  on  the  minutes,  had  conuoenced  so  early  as  the  month  of  March  ISO  4,  being  six  months  antecedent  to  the  period  Mrs.  Clarke  stated  herself  to  have  comiaenced  this  kind  of  traffic.

It  was  not  denied  that  the  1)0,e  allowed  Mrs.  Clarke  to  speak  and  write  to  him  on  the  suOject  of  army  promotions.  He  certainly  did  to  a  degree  con condescend  descend condescend  to  hold  with  her  communichtions  of  that  sort,  but  he  contended  that  his  Royal  Ilighness  was  not.  convicted,  by  any  evidence  before  the  Howe,  of  having  permitted  that  degree  of  interference  in  many  promotions  which  constituted  the  alleged  ground  of  blame  agains  t  him.

It  was  more  than  proba probable  ble probable  that  his  fLoyalllighness  on  this  would  be  acquitted  of  corrupt  connivance.  Let  him  then  suppose  that  there  were  fifty  other  cases  of  improper  promotions  of  the  sal  e.  kind,  still  if  there  was  no  stronger  proof  of  corruption  in  any  of  them  than  in  the  first,  he  would  in  all  probability  be  acquitted  of  the  wh)le,  and  by  that  means  thegerieral  culpability  of  the  person  so  arcused  would  go  unpunished.

But  was  it  not  strange  that  a  woman,  svho  boasted  more  influeace  in  the  disposal  of  places  than  the  Queen  herself,  should,  in  the  space  of  three  months  be  able  to  do  nothing  for  any  one  of  those  who  de depended  pended depended  on  her  interest  with  the  Commander  in  Chief?

There  was  nothing  in  het  evidence  that  seemed  to  be  premeditated.  She  furnished  answers  to  all  that  was  asked  her,  with  the  greatest  facility.

If  E  DUKE  OF  yttn.K.  Lord  MILTON  begged  leave  to  traeble  the  House  with  a  few  words  on  what  secured  to  him  rather  a  curious  argument,  which  had  fallen  from  a  Learned  Judge  who  spoke  second  in  the  debat.  , STYLE=superscript  (Mr.  Burton).  That  Learned  Person  had  said,  that  be because'Mrs.'Clarke  cause'Mrs.'Clarke because'Mrs.'Clarke  was  an  immoral  character,  and  had  contra  , STYLE=superscript  -  dieted  hersef  in  several  parts-  of  her  evidence,  he  would  have  the  whole  of  her  evidence  expunge=d  from  the  Al  buttes.  Now  the  Noble  Lord  could  not  help  thinking,  that  if  that  doctrine  were  to  be  admitted,  it  would  go  to  sweep  away  the  evidence  of  al almost  most almost  every  4itle  who  had  been  heard  at  the  Bar.  From  the  most  deliberate  view  that  he  had  been  able  to  take  of  Airs.

As  to  the  danger  of  removing  , STYLE=superscript  him,  the  Noble  Lord  said  he  could  see  none.  The  Duke  of  Marlborough  was  removed  from  the  command  of  the  army  in  time  of  war,  and  no  injury  occurred  to  the  country  from  his  removal.  If  the  Doke  of  1  ork  lived  ever  so  long,  there  was  no  likelihood  that  he  would  ever  become  a  Duke  of  Marlborough.  it  was  stated  by  a  Right  lion.  Gentleman  (the  Chancellor  of  the  Excheqner),  that  the  Duke  of  York  was  ashamed  and  sorry  for  his  criminality,  that  he  regretted  his  violation  of  the  seventh  commandment,  and  that  he  would  reform.  He  conceived.  however,  that  at  certain  periods  of  life,  habits  became  Seed  and  unchangeable.  His  itosal  Highness  was  now  forty:live  at.  fistty-six  years  of  age,  and  that  was  a  time  of  life  which  did  not  airord  much  hope  for  improvement.  The  Noble  koni  made  some  severe  remarks  on  the  letter  o  f  the  Duke  of  York  to  the  Speaker,  which  he  thought  a  most  blameable  and  ill-advi;ed  measure,  and  coneladed  with  apologising  to  the  noose  fur  having  detained  the  attention  of  the  House  so  long.  Lord  ST  t  V  LRY  after  he  hail  considered  Opp  evidence  from  beginning  to  end,  and  examined  it  in  every  way  that  he  could,  he  found  it  impossible  for  him  to  say  that  the  Duke  of  y  ork  was  innocent—(  Hear  !  Hear  !  )  Many  of  the  cases  certainly  were  not  within  the  rules  laid  &amp;motor  the  guid guidauce  auce guidauce  of  the  Committee,  by  w  hich  they  were  directed  to  confine  their  attention  to  the  investigation  of  military  matters  alone  ;  hut  they  formed  a  chain  of  evidence  against  the  Royal  Mike,  hich  it  was  impossible  to  resist.  It  was  saying  nothing  that  every  thing  appeared  regniar  in  the  hooks  of  the  office.  When  Kennet  applied  'for  a  place,  the  Duke  of  York's  Secretary  wrote  to  Sir  Horace  Mann,  to  procure  a  recommen recommendation  dation recommendation  in  his  favour,  and  in  this  way  it  was  probable  recom recommendations  mendations recommendations  were  procured,  and  sent  to  the  Horse  Guards.  A  great  difference  of  opinion  prevailed  respecting  the  credibility  of  Mrs.  Clarke.  Some  parts  of  her  testrmony  were  satisfactoril  nd  substantially  proved  to  be  true.  The  evidence  of  Miss  Tay Taylor  lor Taylor  he  thought  perfectly  consistent'  and  natural.  A  great  deal  of  stress  had  been  laid  on  the  circunistance  of  the  Duke's  refusing  to  comply  with  Mrs.  Clarke's  terms.  when  she  threat threatened  ened threatened  to  expose  him  unless  they  were  eomplred  with,  and  an  in inference  ference inference  was  drawn  from  thence,  that  he  was  'so  firm  in  the  con consciousness  sciousness consciousness  of  his  innocence,  that  he  spurned  at  proposals  Which,  bad  he  known  he  was  'guilty,  he  must  have  complied  with.—  But  he  - STYLE=superscript  might  be  confident  in  his  own  influence  - STYLE=superscript  and  Con Connections,  nections, Connections,  and  be  persuaded  that  whatever  Mrs.  Clatlie  night  ad advance  vance advance  'against  him  would  be  regarded  as  calumny  .

It  was  in  vain  to  say  that  the  document'vvhich  had  been  phidoced  from  the  office  hall  got  him  his  commission.  He  lived  with  Mrs.  Clarke  in  Tavis Tavistuck-place,  tuck-place, Tavistuck-place,  before  she  went  to  Gloucester-place,  and  she  pro probably  bably probably  might  have  mentioned  Vie  first  recommendation  to  his  Royal  Highness,  but  it  was  clear  that  it  was  Mrs.  Clarke's  in intervention  tervention intervention  alone  which  procured  him  his  commission.

He  differed  from  the  Gentlemen  on  his  side  of  the  Ho  u  se  on  lighter  matters,  but  he  thought  in  his  conscience,  however,  that  the  Duke  of  York  had  been  guilty  of  personal  corruption,  and  theteore  tie  should  vote  for  the  original  AddresS.

General  Gust;  71  said,  with  feelings  of  gratitude  to towards  wards towards  his  Royal  Highness  for  the  many  marks  of  personal  fa favour  vour favour  he  eaperieuced  of  him,  it.  was  ant  . STYLE=superscript  without  the  most  heart heartfelt  felt heartfelt  regret  he  was  obliged  to  ;Ice  a  -,nste  of  censure  on  that  con conduct,  duct, conduct,  to  which,  otherwise,  he  could  bear  ample  testimony  of  the  most  merttornaus  sc  t  vice  to  the  army  and  the  country.  But.  on  aqtlest  ion  Itke  this,  every  feeling  of  private  consideration  mu  st STYLE=superscript  yield  to  public  duty,  and  he  should  conceive  himself  unworthy  of  a  seat  in  that  house,  if  he  was  influenced  by  any  other  motive  than  a  faithful  discharge  of  his  duty.  After  a  most  careful  ierusal  of  all  the  testimony  of  the  witnesses,  and  a  close  examination  of  the  various  documents  on  the  table,  the  re re-6111t  6111t re-6111t  of  that  consideration  has  been,  that  he  was  of  opinion  that  his  Royal  Highness's  conduct  had  been  extremely  culpable.—  Heavy  guilt  rested  upon  him,  and  until  that  guilt  was  disproved.  he  could  not  say  that  the  Commander  in  Chief  could  hold  that  situation  any  longer  with  comfort  to  himself,  or  satisfaction  to  the  public.  The  CHANCELLOR  of  the  Exerttountt  then  rose  for  the  pnrpose  of  moving  his  resolutinn  expressive  of  the  opinion  of  the  guilt  or  innocence  of  the  Duke  of  York.

He  certainly  was  not  prepared  in  framing  his  resolutions  to  meet  the  particular  views  of  each  Gentleman  respectively  on  this  question.  Indeed  he  did  not  conceive  it  consistent  with  what  was  due  to  the  Duke  of  York,  and  the  duty  lie  imposed  upon  himwlf,  to  couch  a  resolution  which  was  to  decide  upon  his  guil  t  or  innocence,  of  the  charges  attributed  to  him  in  general  or  vague  terms  ;  his  object  was  to  bring  the  house  tti  a  decisive  conclusion  Upon  this  important  branch  of  the  quest  ion,  and  leave  such  other  remaining  grounds  of  complaint  as  Gentlemen  might  think  proper  to  ground  a  proceed proceedlug  lug proceedlug  upon  for  seine  other  course  of  deck,lon.  With  respect  to  inno innocent  cent innocent  connivance,  which  a  right  hon.  OPntleman  (Mr.  W  indham)  attributed  to  the  Duke  in  the  course  of  the  debate  on  a  former  night,  namely,  that  kind  of  connivance,  on  his  part,  which  did  not  constitute  that  degree  of  knowledge  of  improper  traffic  in  Military  Promotions  which  could  be  called  criminal  connivance.  lie  would  now  only  say  a  few  words  with  respect  to  the  present  mode  of  proceeding  by  Resolution  and  Address.  Ile  had  before  stated,  and  he  would  again  repeat  it,  that  his  principal  object  in  proceeding  by  Restitution,  was  in  order  to  determine  whether  there  was  ground  for  proceeding  to  trial.  if  the  Duke  of  York  should  he  Anoka  guilty  of  corruption,  or  of  grave  suspicion  of  corruption  or  connivance,  then  upon  a  Resolution  to  that  effect  being  entered  upon  the  Journals  as  a  distinct  opinion,  the  house  might  address  his  Majest)  for  a  dismissal  of  the  Duke,  or  for  an  impeachment  before  his  .Peers.

We  do  not  recollect  a  well  authenticated  instance  of  grace  operating  era  artitlian  of  his  cast,—he  is  incorrigible.  As  it  would  be  danTereus  to  calcu  ate  on  supernatural  causes,  in  attempt attemptingio  ingio attemptingio  explain  the  motives  of  his  acting,  we  must  endeavor  to  account  for  his  present  policy  according  to  those  prin principle:,  ciple:, principle:,  which  st.em  invariably  to  have  guided  the  ambitious  aril  unprincipled.  We  have  con.,tantly  insisted,  in  opposition  to  our  bro brother  ther brother  jourecists,  and  to  a  very  silly  and  a  very  inaccurate  statement  of  Load  CASTLEREAGH,  that  the  French  military  force  is  not  near  so  numerous  as  is  generally  believed  and  stated.  l  is  unquestionably  the  interest  of  BONAPARTE  to  impress  a  very  formidable  opinion  of  the  strength  and  num number  ber number  of  his  armies;  but  we  camiot  possibly  conceive  what  motives  could  operate  on  the  Noble  Lord  to  promote  the  views  of  the  tyrant  in  this  respect.  Ilis  met-statements  must  arise  from  wilful  prevarication,  unpardonable  igno ignorance,  rance, ignorance,  or  he  considered  it  as  a  parliamentary  ruse  de  guerre,  and  therefore  justifiable.  Whatever  his  motives  may  have  been,  it  is  of  the  highest  importance  to  correct  his  error  of  judgment  or  of  design;  and  we  would  wish  to  know  his  authority  for  asserting  that  the  French  bad  400,000  men  at  their  disposal,  ready  to  pour  into  Spain  ;  if  the  force  they  had  already  in  the  Peninsula,  was  inade inadequate  quate inadequate  to  resist  our  army.  We  know  it,  unfortunately,  that  he,  as  well  as  his  colleagues,  and,  in  fact,  every  pre previous  vious previous  administration,  were  grossly  ignorant  on  a  subject  it  was  so  much  their  duty  to  know,  and  which  they  had  the  means  of  ascertaining.  The  French  army,  according  to  the  opinion  of  the  best  informed  men  on  the  continetq,  never  amounted,  for  the  last  eight  years,  to  :;00,000  effective  men.  This  state statement  ment statement  is  corroborated  by  the  authority  or  the  Prince  o  110HENLORE,  and  indirectly  by  that  of  Lord  HUTCHINSON.  We  are  informed  that  his  Lordship  was  of  opinion  the  enemy  had  not  150,000  in  Poland,  during  the  last  cam campaign  paign campaign  in  that  country;  and  we  know  it  to  be  a.  positive  fact,  that  their  whole  force  between  the  Vistula  and  the  Rhine  did  not  amount  to  50,000.  1  h  that  entire  cam campaign  paign campaign  they  were  unable  to  blockade  111  e  small  fortress  of  Colberg,  the  garrison  of  which  were  in  the  habit  of  extend extending  ing extending  their  excursions  for  more  than  50  miles  in  every  direc direction;  tion; direction;  in  one  of  which  they  picked  up  General  i'ic•roa,  who  was  afterwards  exchanged  for  &amp;yen  ea.  •  As  long  as  the  Siege  of  l)autzic  lasted,  their  offensive  operations  on  the  Vistula  discontinued  for  want  of  an  effi effie  e effie  eat  force;  active  warfare  in  that  quarter  was  not  resumed  till  the  besieging  army  had  rejoined  the  main  body.  In  like  manner  they  were  unable  to  oppose  any  thing  like  re resistance  sistance resistance  to  the  Swedish  army  of  15,000  men,  near  Stralsund  and  MoteriFat  was  obliged  to  collect  all  the  Du!ch  troops,  who  occupied  the  banks  of  the  Elhe,  the  Weser  and  the  Fees,  the  ;g  arrisons  of  Ilainhurgh,  Lubeck,  Bremen  and  lianovet,  before  he  Ives  able  to  resist  this  small  force.  We  do  not  include  in  this  statement  the  contingents  of  Ba Bavaria,  varia, Bavaria,  Wurtemberg,  and  Baden,  which  were  mnploved  in  Silesia,  and  which  may  have  amounted  to  about  40,000  men.  From  the  above  statement  it  is  clear  That  the  whole  force  of  the  enemy,  includinz  Dutch,  Italians,  and  Germans,  d  d  not  exceed  250,000  men.  What  renders  us  more  posi positive  tive positive  in  this  opinion,.  is.  its  coincidence  with  a  statement  made  by  the  Prince  of  IIonEN  v.,  in  the  autumn  of  1806.  When  war  between  Prussia  and  Francewas  thought  proba probable,  ble, probable,  he  sent  a  list  to  the  Cabinet  of  Berlin,  collected  with  191  all  the  accuracy  which  the  juncture  required,  of  the  seve several  ral several  corps  at  that  time  in  :;erienny  ;—they  amounted,  ac according  cording according  to  his  report,  to  210,000,  Italians  included.  Airy  man,  who  has  trn  yelled  through  France,  and  in  the  habit  or  making  °brae  vatic:us,  must  have  remarked,  that  scarce  a  :old.er  was  to  be  seen  in  the  interior.  The  enoiry,  at  the  period  we  allude  to,  had  not  40,000  in  the  interim,  the  greater  part  of  which  were  encamped  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Paris,  where  they  were  incessantly  •  exercised  under  the  eyes  of  llosapanTu  himself.  The  garrison  duty  at  Brest,  Touloe,  in  the  fortresses  at  Brabant  &amp;c.  was  performed  by  invalids,  or  the  new  organised  Na National  tional National  troops.  There  was  a  small  force  of  regulars  kept  at  Boulogne,  not  e  exceeding  10,000  men.  For  the  defense  of  Italy  he  has  aliNys  relied  more  on  the  terror  of  his  name,  and  the  inaekvity  of  our  councils,  than  on  any  force  he  ever  maintained  there.  That  is  proved  to  evi evidence  dence evidence  by  the  resistance  which  General  Stewart  made  there  with  his  small  corps.  We  thought  it  of  consequence  to  make  this  statement,  in  order  to  contradict  the  extravagant  accounts  which  are  current  on  this  head  ;  and  we  still  believe,  and  defy  any  one  to  contradict  on  just  grounds  our  F.  tatement,  that  the  French  effective  disposable  force,  Dutch  and  Italians  in included,  cluded, included,  does  not  exceed  300,000  men.  A  great  accession  of  strength,  it  may  be  objected,  has  been  added  by  the  late  conscription  ;  but  has  the  war  in  Spain,  the  mortality  of  a  winter  campaign,  the  rigours  of  French  service,  occasioned  no  loss  ,  equal,  at  least,  in  number,  but  superior  in  eflici efliciency,  ency, efliciency,  to  what  it  gains  by  the  conscription  of  iBO9  amid  ie.  This  ,statement,  we  hope,  will  explain  to  many  of  on:  Readers  the  relaxation  which  is  visible  in  the  policy  of  BON  APA  RTE.  The  great  body  of  his  army  is  in  Spain  ;  and  he  cannot  leithdraw  a  considerable  part  of  it  without  risk risk'  ' risk'  the  loss  of  the  Peninsula.  hence  these  sUmpluous  detail;  of  projected  operations  against  Portugal  and  Andalusia  :  but  which,  for  two  nsonths,  have  consisted  in  Mere  demon demonstration.  stration. demonstration.  Hence  the  addresses  which  pour  in  from  every  province  and  town  in  Spain;  calculated  to  overawe  Austria  into  concessions.  A  visible,  strong  anxiety,  even  an  un uncertainty,  certainty, uncertainty,  begin  to  appear  in  the  councils  of  the  tyrant.  The  supposition,  accounting  for  his  inactivity,  as  it'  he  wished  Austria  to  appear  it  the  thaiacter  of  the  aggressor  s  is  drivelling  in  the  extreme,  end  betrays  a  profound  ig ignorance  norance ignorance  of  the  moral  feeling  and  energy  of  the  indi individual.  vidual. individual.

His  modera moderation  tion moderation  is  the  effect  of  weakneis;  his  justice,  of  incapacity.

Such  was  the  expectation  he  had  entertkined  of  the  conduct  of  the  Honourable  Gentleman,  and  he  must  confess  that  lie  saw  with  surprise  the  course  which  he  had  taken.  The  _Honourable  Gentleman  was  persuaded  that  the  House  ought  to  come  to  a  decision  which  would  have  the  effect  of  displacing  the  Duke  of  York  from  his  0  ice  of  Commander  in  Chief;  but  aft'  :•  allow  ing  all  the  weight  which  was  due  to  the  aro  i'  onients;  on  which  he  founded  that  opinion,  still  it  was  very  doubtful  whether  the  'Louse  t  cold  be  warranted,  to  come  to  such  a  vote.  Was  it  candid  treatment  to  the  Illustrious  Personage  whose  ease  was  'older  con consideration  sideration consideration  to  act  thus  ?  Was  such  a  proceeding  respectful  to  the  first  Personage  in  the  Kingdom,  to  whom  the  Address  was  pro proposed  posed proposed  to  be  presented?  Was  it  consistent  with  Farliamentary  practice,  that  a  vote  so  undecided  as  the  Amendment  of  the  lion.  Geutleman  (Mr.  Bankes)  should  be  preferred  to  one,  which  stated  a  'dear  and  specific  opinion  upon  the  principal  point  of  the  charg  e?  The  Han.  Gentleman  had  said  there  was  no  re record,  cord, record,  n  othing  excepting  the  Journals  of  the  House.  Was  not  slink  record  sufficient?  and,  if  substantiated,  was  it  not  enough  to  blast  the  fame  of  his  Royal  Highness  in  the  eyes  of  posterity  i  Such  then  was  the  effect  of  that  .Amendment  supported  by  the  non.  Gentleman  (  Mr.  Wilberforce)  though  he  was  ready  to  admit  the  charge  of  personal  corruption  and  connivance  had  not  been  proved  (A  cry  of  No!  Aro  !)

SPEA  Ern.  stated  the  question  for  the  consideration  of  the  !louse  to  be  as  follows  humble  Address  having  been  pro proposed,  posed, proposed,  and  a  division  having  taken  place  on  the  expediency,of  proceeding  by  Address,  the  house  came  to  the  determination  of  proceeding  by  a  resolution,  to  the  following  effect  That  Charges  having  been  brought  forward  against  his  Royal  High Highsee.:  see.: Highsee.:  the  Commander  in  Chief,  accusing  him  of  criminal  corrnp corrnpsion  sion corrnpsion  and  connivance  at  certain  abuses  in  army  promotion=,  ap appointments,  pointments, appointments,  &amp;c.  the  house  feels  it  incumbent  to  give  a  distinct  .:nd  pointed  opinion  of  the  truth  or  falsehood  of  those  charges,  e.  ;  on  the  propriety  of  this  resolution,  therefore  this  debate  as  now  to  be  Mr.  PERCCVA  r.  said,  if  the.  Gentlemen  on  the  other  side  of  the  house  bad  no  objection,  he  shouhi  wish  to  withdraw  this  Itesolution  for  the  purpose  of  substituting  another  in  its  room.  As  the  house  had  come  to  the  determination  of  pro proceeding  ceeding proceeding  by  resolution  instead  of  address,  and  as  he  had  no  wish  to►  rescind  that  detcrm+n  a  'io►n,  but  merely  to  substitute  another  resolution,  ►cith  a  little  alteration,  in  its  room,  he  thought  the  purpose  might  be  aitaint.d  without  putting  the  question  to  a  vote.  this  resolution  he  wi-hed  to  add  the  general  opinion  and  settle  tif  :he  house.  ale  had  no  wish,  however,  to  force  its  being  liicawit.  if  the  house  had  any  objection,  lint  he  could  see  u  IUit!OU  why  an  opposition  should  he  gi  vest  to  such  a  step.  MARCH  1  9  Mr.  TIERNEY  said  that  he  had  the  strongest  objection  to  the  Resolution  as  it  Was  w  orded,  imesranch  as  it  would  appear  on  the  Journals  of  the  house,  from  such  a  deter determination,  mination, determination,  that  there  was  in  fact  nothing.  proved  against  his  Royal  2  iglii:ess,  either  on  the  ground  of  criminal  corruption  or  como‘ance,  or  in  any  other  way,  which  shut  out  the.  pi.E:sibi pi.E:sibility  lity pi.E:sibility  of  giving  an  opinion  on  the  other  part  of  his  caadnet,  certainly  deserving  of  the  strongest  animadversion.  In  his  pri private  vate private  character  the  people  had  no  interest,  but  in  his  public  cha character  racter character  their  interest  was  very  materially  concerned  :  it  was  pro probable  bable probable  he  might  one  day  or  other  come  to  the  throne,  and  is  the  charges  exhibited  against  him  of  corruption  were  proved,  a  Will  of  Exclusion  must  necessarily  follow.  if  the  records  on  the  Journals  of  the  house  stated  the  conduct  of  the  Commander  in  Chief  to  he  vicious,  it  would  be  degrading  not  to  follow  that  statement  by  a  representation  that  he  was  unfit  any  longer  to  hold  the  situation  at  the  head  of  military  affairs.  But  he  would  them  come  orfore  the  house  as  a  public  Functionary,  and  if  Royal  Personages  were  to  take  the  situations  of  Public  tionaries,  they  must  of  course,  as  much  as  any  other  person;  and  if  the  house  neglected  to  express  their  condemnation  of  the  im improprieties  proprieties improprieties  which  had  been  proved,  the  whole  country  would  stand  up  in  indignation.  The  Duke  of  York  as  a  man  is  entitled  by  rank  to  every  respect  ;  he  is  a  man  in  private  life  who  is  both  kind  and  beneficient,  but  it  becomes  Members  of  Parliament,  as  a  duty  which  they  owe  to  their  constituents,  however  painful  the  execution  oft  hat  duty  may  he,  to  take  care  that  public  offices  are  not  filled  by  persons  to  whose  character  the  most  trifling  suspicion  is  attached.  Unless  we  express,  as  our  duty  requires,  a  distinct  opinion  of  the  abuses  which  have  been  proved,  we  shall  be  ashamed  to  look  the  public  in  the  face.  WVt  respect  to  the  Letter  from  the  Duke  of  York  to  the  house,  it  appeared  to  him  to  be  the  production,  not  of  his  Royal  Highness  himself,  but  of  the  Cabinet  Ministers.  The  rig!.t  hon.  Gentleman  on  the  other  side  of  the  house  had  accused  the  hon.  Gentleman,  who  brought  forward  the  charges  now  pend pending,  ing, pending,  of  baying  consulted  wiser  and  cooler  heads  than  his  own.  It  might  be  fairly  said,  however,  that  the  Duke  of  York  cons  suited  weaker  heads  than  his  own,  for  he  would  never  have  been  so  base  and  so  mean  as  to  write  such  a  letter,  which  was  evidently  intended  to  form  a  ground  for  the  present  proceed proceeding,  ing, proceeding,  He,  (Mr.  Tierney)  was  ready  to  say,  on  oath,  that  according  to  his  opinion  the  Duke  of  Y  ork  was  nut  guilty  of  corrupt  practices  ;  but  there  were  many  other  Gentle,  men  who  might  be  or  fliliereot  opinions,  and  who  would  be  obliged  to  declare  by  this  vote  what  those  opinions  were.  It  was  to  he  regretted  the  Duke  had  not  resigned,  in  the  first  instance,  which  he  might  have  done  without  any  possible  impu imputation  tation imputation  against  his  character,  and  by  such  condttet  he  would  have  saved  a  great  deal  of  that  unpleasant  feeling  which  pervaded  the  house  on  the  present  occasion.  But,  as  this  case  now  stood,  the  best  method  to  adopt  would  be  to  give  a  general  Virlir  of  the  case;  and  unless  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  thought  proper  to  come  to  this  determination,  he  should  not  be  allowed  to  withdraw  his  resolution.  Mr.  MA  un  tun  Frry.Grt  Ln  begged  for  one  moment  the  at attention  tention attention  of  the  House,  and  reminded  them  ho  w•  very  liable  to  misrepresentations  different  Gentlemen  must  unavoidably  be,  if  they  were  prevented  from  being  sufficiently  audible.  lie  had  felt  it  his  duty  to  vote  for  both  the  Addresses  ;  but  in  doing  so,  he  declared  that  no  Honourable  Member  who  had  voted  on  either  of  the  Majorities  against  those.  Addresses  could  possibly  have  f'ett  greater  pain  than  he  would  at  the  disgrace  or  deg  radation  of  any  branch  of  the  illustrious  family  to  which  the  !loyal  Duke  belonged.  Ile  objected  to  the  Resolution  of  the  Right  Honour,  able  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  because  it  was  professed professedly  ly professedly  to  end  in  an  Address,  supposing  he  had  no  objection  to  the  matter  contained  in  that  Resolution.  Ile  had  voted  for  the  Ad.  dresses,  because  he  approved  of  the  'ratter,  though  he  thought  an  Address  was  not  the  mast  desirable  mode  of  proceeding,  and  that  for  two  reasons  ;  one,  that  he  did  not  think  that  House  was  to  call  in  the  aid  of  the  Crown  to  do  that  which  they  were  suffi sufficient  cient sufficient  to  do  themselves  ;  and  another  was,  that  an  Address  on  such  a  subject  did  not  appear  to  him  to  be  the  best  mode  of  con  . STYLE=superscript  .  slitting  the  feelings  of  a  Sovereign  and  a  Father;  yet  even  with,  those  disadvantages  he  was  compelled  to  vote  for  the  Addresses  in  preference  to  the  Resolutions  of  the  Right  Ilononrable  Gen-  .  demon.  As  to  all  thnt  had  been  said  with  respect  to  out-door  influence,  he  was  far  from  being  disposed  ever  to  let  any  popular  cry  have  any  undue  influence  on  his  vote  in  that  house;  hut  at  the  same  time  he  thought  it  to  he  the  duty  of  the  Representa.  fives  of  the  People,  not  to  be  inditfereat  or  insensible  to  the  pub  lie  opinion.

But  the  career  of  his  virtues  and  exploits,  we  shudder  to  think,  is  already  completed.

Yon  have  taken  assay  a  life,  which  outweighed  in  moral  worth,  in  real  nobility  of  soul,  your  own  and  that  of  the  present  gene generalion  ralion generalion  of  Frenchmen.  We  cannot  conceive  what  incom incomprehensible  prehensible incomprehensible  accident  threw  PALarox  into  the  present  ten tentun  tun tentun  ;—he  belonged  to  an  age  and  a  country,  which  have  been  long  no  more.  His  affections  and  sentiments  were  suGcated  in  the  narrow  cell  of  modern  society.  Rome,  in  her  most  glorious  period,  was  his  country.,  No  other  community  presented  a  theatre  sufficiently  wide  for  the  expansion  of  his  feelings.  for  the  comprehensiveness  of  his  v  iews.  From  that  sublime  picture,  let  us  now  cast  our  eyes  on  that  of  BONAPARTE%—surrounded  with  all  the  glare  of  human  grandeur,—counting  Kings  and  Princes  among  his  vassals  anti  servants  ;—and  behold  him  tortured  with  jealousy  and  fear  ;—a  stranger  on  the  face  of  the  earth  ;  an  outlaw  in  society  ;—labouring  incessantly  and  anxiously  to  be  completely  miserable  ;—distrusting  and  hating  all  mankind,  particularly  the  honest  and  the  good  ;  because  lie  is  conscious  that  he  possesses  and  merits  the  full  measure  AL  REGISTER.  ~..  MARCH  19.  Of  their  detestation.  He  :nay  call  PAL  A  rox  a  coward,  and  die  people  of  Saragossa  a  miserable  rabble  ;  but  if  he  re retain  tain retain  any  trace  of  former  impressions,  he  has  the  mortifi mortifi;iition  ;iition mortifi;iition  to  feel,•  that  even  the  vilest  and  most  obdurate  of  his  own  minions  laugh  at  the  extravagance  of  his  rage,  and  condemn  the  gross  impudence  of  his  falsehood.  We  hope  there  arc  no  more  admirers  in  this  country  of  that  ruffian.  If  there  arc,  and  they  should  have  the  effron effrontery  tery effrontery  to  disclose  that  admiration,  they  should  be  kicked  from  every  society.  Their  admiration  is  complicated  trea treason;—they  son;—they treason;—they  are  traitors  to  their  country  as  well  as  to  all  mankind.  The  journal  which  should  evince  a  single  word  in  extenuation  of  his  crimes,  deserves  to  be  burnt  by  the  hands  gif  the  hangman.  The  defence  of  Saragossa  is,  unquestionably,  the  noblest  monument  of  modern  warfare.  We  find  even  in  antient  records  only  two  examples,  and  those  in  the  very  Peninsula  where  this  has  been  gisen,—Saguntum  and  Numantia.  In  sousequence  of  the  perfection  to  which  the  art  of  is  brought  at  present,  fortresses  of  the  first  order  unahle  to  sastain  a  siege  'of  two  months.  Two  rend)  armies,  concluded  by  three  Marshals,  have  been  .uriployed  for  three  months,  against  a  place,  which  was  no  mtter  than  au  open  town.  Et  .

Dutch  Gazettes  to  the  12th  instant  arrived  on  Friday  in  town.  Their  contents  extinguish  even  the  shadow  of  a  doubt  which  might  have  been  still  entertained  of  a  rupture  between  France  and  Austria.  As  we  always  anticipated,—  the  latter  is  the  aggressor.  We  hail  this  circumstance  as  an  auspicious  symptom  ;—it  is  an  earnest  of  the  resolution  with  which  she  has  determined  to  carry  on  the  contest.  Notwithstanding  the  artifice,  subterfuges,  and  affected  depreciation  which  mark  the  articles  in  the  ,4enitrur,  that  advert  to  the  financial  and  military  resources  of  Austria,  it  is  easy  to  perceise  that  BoNAPARTE  enters  with  great  re reluctance  luctance reluctance  on  the  present  contest.  We  miss  a  strong  feature  in  his  conduct,—that  promptitude  and  rapidity,  which  characterised  his  former  operations.  Almost  two  months  have  already  elapsed  since  his  departure  from  Spain  ;  and  notwithstanding  the  menacing  demonstrations  which  Austria  continued  to  make  since  that  time;  notwithstand notwithstanding  ing notwithstanding  the  jealousy  and  irritation  he  displayed  at  the  conduct  of  that  power,  he  still  continued  his  efforts  to  compromise  the  subject  of  dispute  by  negociation.  We  are  justified  to  draw  two  conclusions  on  the  occasion,—that  his  present  means  arc  inadequate  to  carry  on  the  contest  with  a  cer cerfalnty  falnty cerfalnty  of  success  . STYLE=superscript  ;  and  that  a  new  war  is  extremely  wipo  . STYLE=superscript  pular  in  France.  These  conclusions,  if  well  founded,  will  account  for  that  tissue  of  falshood  and  abuse  which  are  so  prominent  in  the  remarks  of  the  French  and  Dutch  Jour•  mils.  Previous  to  the  two  last  campaigns  on  the  Danube  and  the  Saal,  when  the  tyrant  was  sure  of  his  prey,  he  glaringly  affected  the  very  reverse  of  this  conduct;  and  em employed  ployed employed  a  nauseous  strain  of  sympathy  and  regret  when  he  adverted  to  the  infatuation  of  the  courts  of  Vienna  and  Berlin.  This  detectable  cant  was  never  used  with  more  un unblushing  blushing unblushing  insolence,  than  during  the  short  interval  of  a  few  days,  which  intervened  between  the  time  of  his  arrival  at  Wurtzburg  and  the  battle  of  Jena.  After  he  had  already  decreed  the  doom  of  the  Prussian  monarchl  ;  after  his  armies  had  begun  their  march  in  every  direction  ;  and  in  proportion  as  they  approached  the  frontiers  of  Saxony,—  the  language  of  the  wily  ruffian  became  more  conciliatory  P14_TB00011 anu  naminb  ail  armies  had  begun  their  march  in  every  direction  ;  and  in  14  the  good  ;  because  proportion  as  they  approached  the  frontiers  of  Saxony,—  rits  the  full  measure  the  language  of  the  wily  ruffian  became  more  conciliatory  ; ",0002644/1809//0319/0002644_18090319_mets.xml
