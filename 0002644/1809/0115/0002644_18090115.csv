Jupt  as  they  put  off,  a  wave  struck  the  biiat,  which  instantly  was  upset  in  the  sOit  of  a  number  of  people,  and  only  two  were  saved.

B.  Commander  in  Chief  of  his  Alaje6ty's  Forces  employed  in  Spain  :  Bencrente,  Dec.  28,  1803.  Since  I  had  the  honour  to  address  you  upon  the  16th,  from  Coro,  the  Army  has  been  almost.  constantly  marching  through  snow,  and  with  cold  that  has  been  very  intense.  The  weather  within  these  few  days,  has  turned  to  rain,  which  is  much  more  .nacon►tortabie  than  the  cold,  and  has  rendered  the  roads  ahnost  impassable.  On  the  21st  the  Army  reached  Sahagun  ;  it  was  nece,,sar%  to  halt  there  in  order  to  refresh  the  men,  and  on  ae aeconnt  connt aeconnt  of  provisions.  The  information  1  received  was  that  Marshal  Soul  t  was  at  Saldana  with  about  sixteen  thousand  men,  with  posts  at  o  m;  the  river  frotn  Cuarda  to  Carrion.  The•  Army  was  ordered  to  march  in  two  columns  at  eight  o'clock  on  the  night  of  the  `3d,  to  force  the  bridge  at  Carrion,  And  from  thence  proceed  to  Saldana.  At  six  o'clock  that  even evening.,  ing., evening.,  I  received  information,  that  considerable  reinforcements  had  •arrived  at  Carrion  from  Palencia,  and  a  letter  from  the  Alartbn  is  tie  lit  Itomana  infor►ned  me,  that  the  French  were  advancing  from  Madrid,  either  to  Valladolid  or  Salamanca.  It  %vas  evident,  that  it  was  toe►  late  to  prosecute  the  attempt  upon  Soult,  that  I  must  be  salisfied  with  the  diversion  I  had  occasioned,  and  that  I  had  no  time  to  lose  to  secure  my  retreat.  .  .  The  next  morning  Lieuteamit-General  Hope,  with  his  own  Ii  vision  and  that  of  Lieu  0  oust-General  Fraser,  marched  to  Thijorga.  I  sent  Sir  David  Baird  with  his  division  to  pass  the  river  at  'Valencia,  and  followed  L.  ieut.-1  ktneral  Hope  on  t  he  251  h  ith  the  reserve  and  the  light  brigado  , STYLE=superscript  :,  by  Mljorga,  ValderaB,  Benevent  , STYLE=superscript  .

Generals  Hope  and  Fraser  are  already  gone  on  ;  Sir  David  Baird  proceeds  to tomorrow  morrow tomorrow  from  'Valencia;  and  I  shall  leave  this  with  the  reserve  it  the  same  time  ;  Lord  Paget  s  ill  remain  with  the  cavalry,  to  lye  us  notice  of  the  approach  of  the  enemy  ;  hitherto  their  tufantry  have  not  come  up,  but  they  are  near,  and  the  cavalry  is  round  us  in  great  numbers;  they  are  checked  by  our  cavalry,  which  have  obtained,  by  their  spirit  and  enterprise,  an  ascend-.  ancy  over  that  of  the  French,  which  nothing  but  great  superiority  of  numbers  an  their  part  will  get  the  better  of.  The  diversion  made  by  our  march  on  Sahagun,  though  at  great  risk  to  ourselves;  has  been  complete  ;  it  remains  to  be  seen  what  advantage  the  Spaniards  in  the  South  will  be  able  to  take  of  it  ;  but  the  march  of  the  French  on  Badajoz  was  stcpped  when  its  advanced  guard  had  reached  Talaveira  de  la  Reine,  and  every  thing  dispmable  is  now  turned  in  this  direction.

0014,"JAN.  15.  ship,  ia  my  letter  of  the  16th,  the  success  Brigadier-General  Stewart  had  met  with  met  with  in  defeatiwg  a  detachment  of  cavalry  at  Itueda.  Since  that,  few  days  have  passed  without  his  taking  or  killing  ditterent  pavtks  of  the  French,  generally  su superior  perior superior  in  force  to  those  which  attacked  them.  On  the  march  to  Sahagun,  Lord  Paget  had  information  of  6  or  700  cavalry  being  in  that  town.  lle  marched  on  the  niZilt  of  the2Oth  from  some  villages  where  he  was  posted  in  front  the  riemy  at  ,Nlajorgo,  with  the  10th  and  15th  hussars.  11:1  :aarch  , STYLE=superscript  -fl  straight  to  the  town,  whilst  Lord  Paget,  Niith  the  15th,  endeavoured  to  turn  it.  Unfortunately  he  fell  in  with  a  patrol,  one  of  whom  escaped  and  gave  the  alarm.  By  this  means  the  French  had  time  to  form  on  the  outside  of  the  town  before  Lord  Paget  got  round.  Ile  immediately  charged  them,  beat  them,  and  took  from  140  to  150  prisoners,  amongst  whom  were  two  Lieutenant Lieutenantmels  mels Lieutenantmels  and  eleven  Officers,  with  the  loss  on  our  part  of  six  or  eight  men,  and  perhaps  20  wounded.  There  have  been  taken  by  the  cavalry  from  4  to  500  French,  besides  a  considerable  number  killed  :  this  since  we  begun  our  march  from  Salamanca.  On  his  march  from  Sahagtm,  on  the  MO,  Lord  Paget,  with  two  squadrons  of  the  10th,  attacked  a  detachment  of  cavalry  at  Majorga,  killed  20,  and  took  above  100  prisoners.  Our  cavalry  is  very  superior  in  quality  to  any  the  French  have  ;  and  the  right  spirit  has  been  infused  into  them  by  the  example  and  inrtruction  of  their  two  leaders,  Lord  Paget  and  Brigadier-General  Stewart.  Astor:  a,  Dec.  31,  1808.  I  arrived  here  yesterday.  Major-General  Fraser,  with  his  division,  will  be  at  Villa  Franca  this  day,  and  will  proceed  on  to  Lugo.  Lieutenant-General  Rope,  with  his  division,  stopped  nsterday  two  leagues  from  this,  and  proceeds  this  morning,  followed  by  Sir  David  Baird.  The  two  flank  brigades  go  by  the  road  of  Penferada.  I  shall  follow,  with  the  reserve  and  cavalry,  to  Villa  Franca,  either  this  night  or  to-morrow  morn morning,  ing, morning,  according  as  I  hear  the  approach  of  the  French.  The  morning  I  marched  from  Benevente,  some  squadrons  of  Bona Bonaparte's  parte's Bonaparte's  Guards  passed  the  river  at  a  ford  above  the  bridge.  They  were  attacked  by  Brigadier-General  Stewart,  at  the  head  of  the  piquets  of  the  15th  and  3d  German  Light  Dragoons,  and  driven  across  the  ford.  Their  Colonel,  a  General  of  Division,  Lefebvre,  was  taken,  together  with  about  seventy  Officers  and  men.  The  affitir  was  well  contested.  The  numbers  with  which  Brigadier-General  Stewart  attacked  were  inferior  to  the  French  ;  it  is  the  corps  of  the  greatest  character  in  their  army;  but  the.  superiority  of  the  British  was,  lam  told,  very  conspicuous.  I  enclose,  for  your  Lordship's  satisfaction,  Lord  Paget's  report  of  it.  Benevente,  Dec.  29.  SIR--I  have  the  honour  to  inform  you,  that  about  nine  o'clock  this  morning,  1  received  a  report  that  the  enemy's  cavalry  was  in  the  act  of  crossing  the  river  at  the  ford  near  the  bridge.  I  immediately  sent  down  the  piquets  of  the  night  under  Lieutenant-  Colonel  Otway  of  the  ISth.  Having  left  orders  that  the  cavalry  should  repair  to  their  alarm  posts,  1  went  forward  to  reconnoitre,  and  found  four  squadrons  of  Imperial  Guards  formed  and  skirmishing  with  the  picquets  and  other  cavalry  in  the  act  of  passing.  I  sent  for  the  10th  hussars,  who  having  arrived,  Bri Brigadier-General  gadier-General Brigadier-General  Stewart  immediately  placed  himself  at  the  head  of  the  piquets,  and,  with  the  utmost  gallantry,  attacked.  The  10th  hussars  supported  in  the  most  perfect  order.  The  result  of  the  affair,  as  far  as  t  have  yet  been  able  to  collect,  is  about  3O  killed,  25  wounded,  70  prisoners,  and  about  the  same  number  of  horses..  It  is  impossible  for  me  to  avoid  speaking  in  the  highest  terms  of  all  those  engaged.  Otway  and  Major  Bergwidel  headed  the  respective  night  piquets.  The  latter  is  slightly  wounded.  The  utmost  zeal  was  conspicuous  in  the  whole  of  my  StiB  and  1  had  many  volunteers  from  head-quarters,  and  other  t)tiix•rs  of  your  army.  Amongst  the  prisoners  is  the  General  of  Div  ion  Lefebvre,  (who  tom-wands  the  eavalry  of  the  Imperial  Guard),  and  two  Captains.  Our  loss  is,  I  fear,  nearly  fifty  men  killed  acid  wounded.  I  will  send  a  return  the  moment  1  can.  collect  the  reports.-1  film  the  honouo  he,  Sze.

We  have  inserted  the  articles  of  this  Capitula Capitulation  tion Capitulation  ;  and  they  furnish  too  much  cause  to  suspect  Motu.%  and  his  associates  of  treachery.  How  afflicting  it  is  to  ac accuse  cuse accuse  a  General,  once  so  high  in  our  estimation  of  so  dis disgraceful  graceful disgraceful  a  crime.

We  feel  au  unusual  reluctance  to  accuse  a  Span Spannigh  nigh Spannigh  nobleman  of  treachery  ;  for  we  find  few  examples  in  their  history,  of  a  Spaniard  being  a  traitor  to  his  country.  This  capitulation  was  drawn  up  with  a  great  deal  of  art,  and  was  probably  dictated  by  'Boys  eAr,T  e  himself,  without  even  deigning  to  consult  the  Spanish  Generals.  He  acted  no  doubt  in  concert  with  them.  Every  article  is  calculated  to  flatter  the  prejudices,  and  appease  the  ani animosity  mosity animosity  of  the  inhabitants.  But  the  most  curious  circum circumstance  stance circumstance  is,  that  the  mune  of  his  brother  is  not  once  mentioned  in  the  whole  transaction  ;  nor  has  he  figured  as  yet  in  any  of  the  Bulletins  dated  from  Madrid.  For Formerly  merly Formerly  every  thing  was  done  in  the  name  of  King  JosEpu  ;  and  now  he  is  as.little  adverted  to  as  if  he  had  never  ex existed.  isted. existed.  The  small  star  is  quite  absorbed  in  the  bright  glare  of  the  Imperial  sun.  It  will  be  a  fortunate  circum circumstance  stance circumstance  for  JOSEPH,  if  he  recovers  the  throne  of  Naples;  for  NAPOLEON  seems  to  have  a  strong  desire  to  appropriate  to  his  own  use  the  throne  of  Spain.  A  RepoFt  was,prevalent  in  the  course  of  the  week  that  an  Engagement  had  taken  place  between  the  rear  of  the  British  army  and  the  advanced  guard  of  the  enemy.  Our  troops  are  said  to  have  been  completely  victorious.  In  the  last  dispatches  from  Sir  J.  MooaE,  we  have  remarked  no nothing  thing nothing  which  could  induce  us  to  believe  that  an  occurrence  of  that  kind  was  so  very  near  at  hand  ;  but  we  do  not  deny  the  possibility  of  it,  because  we  know  the  French  are  in  the  habit  of  transporting  a  body  of  infantry  behind  an  equal  number  of  horsemen.  However,  this  we  can  boldly  assert,  that  if  such  an  event  has  occurred,  and  there  has  been  anything  like  a  parity  of  numbers,  the  efforts  of  our  soldiers  have  been  equally  glorious  and  successful.  We  can  no  longer  be  accused  of  fostering  extravagant  prejudices,  by  antici anticicipating  cipating anticicipating  the  most  splendid  result  from  the  exertions  of  our  army;--the  late  official  account  from  Sir  JOHN  MoORE  justify  an  anticipation  of  every  thing  great  and  noble,  that  undaunted  bravery,  or  distinguished  discipline  are  ca capable  pable capable  of  performing.  What  rapturous  sensations  must  this  consciousness  of  the  superiority  of  our  troops  afford  every  individual,  who  is  interested  in  the  honour  and  prosperity  of  his  country.  Our  naval  pre-eminence  over  the  enemy,  the  vainest  and  most  arrogant  nation  existing,  did  not  dare  to  dispute;  and  the  superiority  of  our  land  forces  is  now  ually,.-coaspicuous.  We  have  fre4iiently  recommended  the  necessity  of  a  floating  army,  whose  operations  should  extend  frnin  the  Mediterranean  to  the  Channel.  It  appears  to  be  now  the  intention  of  government  to  resort  to  this  kind  of  warfare.  We  sincerely  exult  in  thisdetermination,  for  there  is  no  one  mode  of  annoyance  inure  calculated  to  distract  tbe  atten attention  tion attention  of  the  enemy.  Ile  is  assailable  on  every  side;  and  when  he  collects  a  sufficient  force  to  repel  ours,  we  ernly:rlz  again,  and  in  48  hours  a  lauding  is  made  200  miles  riii.ther  oil:  The  whole  regular  army  of  the  French  is  not  sufficient  to  protect  their  coasts,  as  long  as  we  are  masters  of  :he  Ocean;  and  it  would  be  necessary  to  draw  an  iron  barrier  of  awned  men  round  their  extended  shores,  to  prevent  our  landing.  As  this  of  warfare  is  now  in  contempla contemplation,  tion, contemplation,  it  is  of  the  hi,  - STYLE=superscript  :iest  importance  we  should  make  a  dilference  between  the  l'renl,h  and  the  nations  they  subju subjugated,  gated, subjugated,  and  to  subject  fo'iner  exclusively  to  its  pres pressure.  sure. pressure.  This  will  be  attended  with  several  advantages,  ex exclusive  clusive exclusive  of  the  justice  of  the  mea.:are.  The  enemy  in  ordf.r  to  protect  their  own  coasts,'  will  be  obliged  to  withdraw  rile  greater  part  of  their  troops  Italy  and  the  North  of  Germany  ;  and  a  chance  , STYLE=superscript  will  be  Las  given  to  the  natives  toassert  their  independence.  Th...  1  r  ill  be  obli  c  .,;eil  a  the.  same  time  to  call  out  on  permanent  duty  the  National  Guards,  who  together  with  the  regulars,  ordered  from  the  conquered  provinces,  will  occasion  a  vast  accumulation  of  expense  to  the  French  Government.  The  exct!ssive  duties  ofsuch  a  service,  the  contributions  raise  :1  on  the  towns  and  open  country,  the  losses  sustained  by  the  peasantry,  will  occasion  such  loud  discontent,  that  the  tyrant  will  be  forced  to  detach  a  part  of  the  farce  he  has  now  in  Spain  in  order  to  check  the  murmurs  of  the  French,  and  to  defend  their  Shores.  This  system  of  retaliation  should  be  immediately  carried  into  execution,  and  extend  from  Dunkirk  to  Nice;  and  no  further  either  to  the  North  or  South.  It  should  be  carried  on  with  extreme  vigour,  and  with  as  much  indifference  for  the  feelings  of  the  enemy,  as  they  have  uniformly  manifested  towards  others,.  They  should  be  taught,  by  experience,  to  feel  the  disasters  of  the  Spaniards;  and  after  having  sustained  as  a  conse consequence  quence consequence  of  legitimate  retaliation  a  part  of  the  calamities.  they  have  so  wantonly  brought  on  other  nations,  they  may  grow  more  averse,  for  the  future,  to  second  the  destruc destructive  tive destructive  projects  of  their  savage  chieftain.  Let  them  feel•  keenly  the  chastisement  ;  for  a  people  dead  to  all  moral  sense,  and  totally  callous  to  every  thing  that  does  not  affect  themselves  individually,  must  smart  severely  under  the  lash,  before  they  are  roused  from  their  torpid  in indifference.  difference. indifference.  According  to  the  latest  accounts  from  America,  the  Embargo  Act  not  only  continues  in  force,  but  there  is  every  probability  that  a  Non-Intercourse  Bill  will  be  passed  against  Great  Britain  and  France.

How  this  new  measure  of  rigour,  in  addition  to  the  grievances  of  the  Embargo,  will  please  the  Americans,  it  is  not  difficult  to  conjecture;  but  to  judge  from  the  private  and  public  communications  received  from  that  country,  we  are  strongly  inclined  to  believe  that  the  violence  of  the  Antifederalisis  is  preparing  some  dreadful  explosion  in  the  United  States.  •  A  dissolution  of  the  present  Union  is  more  than  probable,  should  the  .  .  1  CT:S)  P10_TB00011 I  P10_TB00012 ~  ~  4  P10_TB00013 W  P10_TB00014 If  P10_TB00015 • ",0002644/1809//0115/0002644_18090115_mets.xml

It  is  stated  that  CASTANOS  and  I.T.smas  have  been  both  arrested,  and  that  MORLA  has  gone  over  to  the  enemy.  We  must  be  cautious  how  we  give  implicit  credit  to  these  accounts  of  treachery  ;  for  we  know  it  to  be  one  of  the  in infernal  fernal infernal  arts  which  th  6  enemy  has  most  successfully  emplosed  agaist  his  adversaries  ;  but  an  official  report  from  Geee  ral STYLE=superscript  O'N  ELL  to  PALAFOICI  immediately  after  the  battle  of  'Cu-dela,  plainly  imputes  to  the  incapacity  or  treachery  of  CAs-  T  ANOS,  A  the  toss  of  that  engagement.  In  either  case  he  de deserved  served deserved  to  be  arrested  ;  and  the  Spanish  General,  who  in  the  present  crisis  of  his  country,  can  be  guilty  of  visAing  the  head-quarters  of  the  enemy,  for  te  purpose  of  did  signing  any  thing  in  the  form  of STYLE=superscript  a  Capitulatiohn,  as  MORLA  ,  de deserves  serves deserves  to  he  punished  as  a  traitor.

One  of  these  adversaries  of  popular  preachers  presents  himself  where  such  species  of  opposition  ought  to  have  been  least  A  ikneficed  clergyman  in  the  says  the  Anti-Jacobin  Review,  page  iB,  for  December  last,  should  not  pass  one  lialfof  the  year  in  frequenting  places  of  fashionable  resort,  or  ID  great  towns;  and  a  good  parish  priest  is  a  mach  more  re respectable  spectable respectable  character  than  any  popular  Without  demanding  for  what  purpose  an  invidious  distinction  Is  here  drawn  between  the  popular  preacher  and  the  parish  priest;  why,  it  may  be  asked,  cannot  the  same  man  be  at  once  *good  parish  priest  and  a  respectable  popular  preacher?  Be Because  cause Because  he  possesses  qualities  and  qnalifications  w  hick  enable  hid.  to  command  the  pulpit,  is  he,  therefore,  unfitted  to  discharge  the  parochial  duties  of  the  priest  ?  Does  not  religious  faith  ordina ordinarily  rily ordinarily  come  by  bearing,  and  attentive  hearing  by  acceptable  smashing  Is  it  not,  indeed,  to  the  paucity  of  the  number  of  esteemed  preachers,  that  we  are  to  attribute  the  desertion  of  too  Many  of  oar  churches  ;  and,  are  the  closet  exhortations  of  any  divine  likely  to  be  less  efficacious,  because  his  public  discourses  ore  numerously  attended,  and  perfectly  appreciated,  by  his  coil coilgregation  gregation coilgregation  ?  There  is  no  insuperable  bar,  no  impassable  gulf,  Netween  the  honourable  elevation  of  the  popular  preacher  and  sloe  dignified  humility  of  the  parish  priest.  What  is  a  popular  preacher  ?—lle  is  one  who  is  disinterested-  Tot  distinguished,  who  has  honestly  acquired  the  suffrages  of  the  people.  He  ~naiad  no  surreptiiious  superiority.  lie  is  great,  ,  assavell  as  good;  and,  while  he  most  conscientiously  discharges  tl:e  unostentatious  avocations  of  the  priest,  he  also  confers  lustre  i  his  sublime  station  as  a  preacher.  He  is  both  t!se  clew  of  the.'  4.sseutiow  and  the  manna  of  the  dcsart.  It  is  mistaking,  if  it  be  not  designedly  misrepresenting,  the  popular  preacher,  when  he  is  described  as  actuated  only  by  the  trvt  of  fame;  as  one  who  conceives  !iimseil  pricik•ged  to  ts  pas  s  arte  half  of  the  year  in  frequenting  places  of  fashionable  resort,  4r  in  great  He  will,  if  he  knows  and.  feels  his  duty,  samtent  himself  with  parochial  popularity.

If  this  critic  be  a  cleric,  which  I  now  'ore  than  suspect,  it  seems  no  violation  of  mental  charity  to  believe  that  he  is  one  of  those  beneficed  clergymen  who  pass  ode  half  of  the  year  in  frequenting  places  of  fashionable  resort,  or  in  great  He,  and  such  as  him,  do  not,  ofeourse,  belong  to  iy  definition  of  a  popular  preacher.  Pulpiteers  are  not  preachers.  ilighly  serviceable  and  nsefully  eminent,  still  let  us  cordially  air  low  to  the  popular  preacher,notwithstanding  thoseabuses  incident  to  cleri,cal  popularity,  the  aseendaocy  to  which  he  seems  'post  hes  !  nourably  entitled.  Since  spiritual  shepherds  are  not  wholly  exempted  even  from  the  very  benefit'  influence  of  envy,  but  are  men  of  like  passions  with  the  weakest  of  their  flocks,  it  may  become  those  of  them,  who  habitually  condemn  popular  preach preaching,  ing, preaching,  to  canvass  their  hearts  ae  to  the  causes  of  such  disapptoba  l  tion;  and  to  ascertain,  with  the  precision  of  real  piety  ?  bow  far  their  own  inablility  to  obtain  popularity,  does,  thirties  .  knowingly  on  their  part,  incite  then)  todeery  the  merit  of  popes  laxity  in  other  preachers?  If  what  we  tall  popularity  is  sot  the  object—it  can  never  be  the  end  !—of  any  plows  preacher.  is  he  to  abase  himself,  or  endure  the  persecution  of  others,  became  he  happens  to  have  honestly  acquired  the  highest  estimation  among  his  contemporaries?  Christianity  does  nor  enjoin  this  kind  of  penance,  and  humanity  does  not  exact  it.  Circumstances  appeared  to  me  to  require  some  explanation  of  my  own  sentiments  respecting  popular  preaching.  Having  so  far  explained,  let  me  trust  not  unsatisfactorily,  my  tbonghts  on  that  subject,  I  proceed  with  the  immediate  business  of  thia  paper.  It  is  the  honour  of  the  present  preacher,  the  Rev.  RICHARD  YATES,  that  he  owes  his  respectability  to  those  causes  by  which  the  individual  becomes  estimable  to  society;  that  whatever  eminence  he  has  obtained,  either  ecclesiastical  or  lite literary,  rary, literary,  is  the  result  of  ability,  ofesertioe,  and  of  integrity.  He  is  of  Jesus  College,  in  the  University  of  Cambridge.  He  has  been  many  years  Chaplain  to  his  Majesty's  Royal  Hospital,  at  Chelsea,—a  painful  and  arduous  preferment,  the  very  active  duties  of  which  he  fulfils  most  exemplarily.  Ile  is  also  Rector  of  Eve,  alias  Ashen;  and,  what  brings  him  directly  under  my  cognizance  in  this  place,  he  is  now  Alternate  Preacher,  in  eon.  eert  with  the  Rev,  Isaac  Jacktuan,  to  the  Philanthropic  Sod.  et  v.  lie  is  unmarried.  Air.  Yates  appears  advantageously  in  the  pulpit.  His  person  tall,  and  hat.  much  of  gentlemanly  dignity  ;  his  deportment  is  grave,  without  the  remotest  approximation  to  pompousness;  and  his  manner,  which  is  uniformly  interesting,  is  often  ani animated,  mated, animated,  and,  sometimes,  deeply  affecting.  His  countenance  is  highly  expressive  of  his  intelligence  and  sincerity  us  a  preacher.  If  he  would  still  more  disembarrass  himself  from  the  trammels  of  manuscript,  to  which,  from  his  apparent  solicitude  as  to  correctness,  he  pays  ton  much  attention,  he  would  rise  greatly  in  the  effect  of  his  public  delivery.  His  discourses  are  plain,  and,  generally,  practical.  With•  out  being  loaded  with  ornament,  his  language  is  not  deficient  either  in  elegance  or  eloquence.  I  have  observed,  however,  that  his  sentences  are  sometimes  so  run  out,  as  to  become  rather  in•  volved;  and,  that  they  abound  too  much  in  parentheses.  It  is  on  subjects  of  humanity  nr  benevolence,  n  he  re  the  h  ear  t  communicates  its  warm►h  to  the  imagination,  that  this  preaelsof  most  iudisputably  excels.  Whether  the  occasion  be  private  or  public,  on  which  his  abilities  are  called  forth,—wbetber  It  hp  to  animate  the  social  sympathies  to  the  practice  of  the  •  tive  duties,  or  to  rouse  individual  kindness  is  aid  of  diffusive  charity,-.-it  is  on  these  occalioas  that  Mr.  Yates,  to  adopt  P12_TB00011 P12_TB00012 1  • ",0002644/1809//0115/0002644_18090115_mets.xml
0033,"THE  14ATIONAL  REGISTEIt:  I  the  words  of  one  of  oar  most  illustrious  writers,  can  teach  tt.e  passions  to  move  at  the  command  of  virtue.  Hence  his  name  i,:  betnanely  enrolled  among  the  really  valuable  members  of  more  than  one  of  those  philanthropic  institutions  which  reflect  lustre  on  our  Metropolis  ;  and-  hence,  ton,  he  is  continually  called  upon  publicly  to  plead  the  cause  of  the  afflicted  and  destitute  !  I  find,  from  edi.ntry  newspapers  which  actideotally  came  under  my  inspection,  that  about  the  middle  of  last  October,  Mr.  Yates,  who  had  then  gone  to  the  sea-side  in  quest  of  health,  Collected,  by  means  Of  varidus  sermons  preached  by  him  in  Brighton  and  its  vicinity,  the  sum  of  2421.  on  behalf  of  the  Deaf  and  Dumb  Children,  educated  in  .  the  Asylum  at  Bermondsey.  The  contribution  at  the  Chapel  Royal,  at  Brighton,  amounted  to  1881.  ;  and,  It  is  added,  that  the  collection,  at  this  chapel,  had  on  no  similar  occasion  exceeded  1001.  There  is  likewise  now  before  me  a  Sermon,  preached  at  the  Anniversary  of  the  Royal  Humant  Society,  on  the  llith  of  April,  1801,  which  does  high  credit  to  the  feelings  and  talents  of  this  preacher.  The  same  charitable  indefatigability,  the  same  spirit  of  going  about  doing  good,  early  engaged  Mr.  Yates  in  promoting  the  establishment  of  the  Literary  Fund;  of  which  society  he  has  long  evinced  himself  truly  estimable  as  a  member,  and  is  al  this  time  one  of  its  Treasurers.  I  have  adverted  to  the  rank  which  this  Gentleman  sustains  in  the  world  of  letters.  His  Monastic  History  of  St.  Edmund's  Bury,  proves  with  what  justice  he  bears  the  distinction  of  F.S.  A.:  while  he  has  recently  circulated  proposals  for  publishing,  undtr  the  patronage  of  the  Eat!  of  Chichester,  '  Memoirs  of  Public  Charities:  an  Historical  Illustration  of  the  origin,  progress,and  present  state  of  the  Charitable  Institutions  in  and  around  the  Cities  of  London  and  Westminster;  with  Historical  Anecdotes  illustrative  of  their  beneficial  effects,  and  Biographical  Notices  of  the  Founders,  most  active  Supporters,  and  chief  Benefactors  of  the  several  Institutions?'  He  is  perfectly  qualified  for  this  laborious,  but,  if  fully  accomplished,  useful  and  meritorious  undertaking.  The  whole  task  of  education  at  the  university,  public  Schools,  private  families,  and  in  foreign  travels  devolves  upon  the  clergy.  A  great  part  of  the  literature  of  their  adds  the  Edinburgh  Reviewer  whom  I  have  already  quoted,  44 STYLE=superscript  is  in  their  May  there  never  be  wanting  clergymen  to  undertake  the  education  of  our  youth  ;  and  may  the  whole  task  of  continue  for  ever  in  their  Lamentable  *ill  be  the  state  of  morals  among  us,  if  ever  any  essential  portion  gi  of  the  task  of  is  transferred  from  the  clergy  of  our  Country.  As  to  the  literature  of  their  it  is  another  source  of  satisfaction  to  me  when  I  am  told  that  great  of  this  also  in  the  of  ecclesiastics.  In  what  other  could  it  be  so  eligibly  placed  ?  I  wish,  let  me  boldly  confess  it,  that  even  more  of  our  literature  was  under  the  superintendence  of  our  clergy.  It  is  pleasing,  it  is  seriously  gratifying  to  me,  when,  as  in  the  instance  of  the  Rev.  Mr.  Yates,  I  perceive  clergymen  commendably  interested  in  the  cultivation  of  literature,  puu  demonstrating,  by  the  productions  of  the  study,  that  their  mental  ardour  does  not  evaporate  in  the  pulpit  ;  but  that,  familiarising  themselves  lo  intellectual  and  laudable  exertion,  they  carry  with  them,  into  every  department  of  useful usefulness,  ness, usefulness,  those  qitalifitations  which,  without  improperly  interfer interferire;  ire; interferire;  with  their  legitimate  and  higher  pursuits,  render  them  berme  icial  and  eligible  characters  in  human  society.  Of  this  order  of  excellence  is  Mr.  Yates.  Estimable  as  a  Oreaciter,  and  approved  as  a  scholar,  he  is  also  extensively  rc rcepected,  epected, rcepected,  as  a  man;  and  while  he  is  applauded  for  his  public  talents  and  attainments,  he  is,  if  possible,  still  more  valued  for  those  private  virtues  which  tnost  eesentiaily  conduce  to  the  sum  4f  general  happiness.  14,  Oxxszmus.

For  reasons  which  we  have  already  explained,  we  forbear  descanting  on  Mrs.  Siddons'  excellence.  She  seems  doomed  ne never  ver never  to  feel  the  blighting  hand  of  age,  and  we  only  point  out  the  beauties  and  defects  of  withering  and  perishable  beings  like  our-  •  selves.

Mr.  Young  not  only  possesses  the  faculty  of  expressing  the  loudest  intonations  of  passion  with  proper  effect,  but  his  voice  ill  s  ,fter,  though  not  perhaps  less  affecting  passages,  sinks  into  a  reeling  plaintiveness  that  steals  to  the  heart.  His  picture  of  mental  and  bodily  sufferings  in  the  last  scene  was  dreadful,  but  chastely  just,  and  in  every  part  of  his  performance  in  .11  arbeth  and  Beverley,  be  proved  himself  worthy  to  act  by  the  side  of  the  British  Melpomene.  The  recaptite;  which  the  public  granted  him,  and  which  he  so  highly  deserved  cannot  fail  to  awaken  all  the  energies  of  his  genius.  Emulation  is  the  nurse  of  excellence.  Were  we  to  place  him  now  at  the  head  of  our  tragic  performers,  we  should  be  guilty  of  flattery  and  would  deprive  him  of  a  stimulus  for  fu future  ture future  exertions.  We  know  his  cowers,  and  judge  him  according  to  their  extent,  and  not  to  those  of  others.  We  will  not  there therefore  fore therefore  foolishly  exclaim,  that  he  has  reached  perfection,  although  he  may  have  surpassed  some  or  even  all  his  competitors,  but  when  experience  and  study  shall  have  enabled  him  to  exert  the  full  force,  and  display  the  real  excellence  of  his  genius.

This  - STYLE=superscript  et  of  government;  and  unless  we  adopt  it  cur  political  conduct,  we  may  continue  to  ,  useless  sacrifices  of  money  and  men,  with withsingle  single withsingle  object  worth  contending  for,  or  se se-1  -1 se-1  safety.

To  •  appreciate  our  means,  moral  and  physical,  let  us  suppose  a  CHATHAM,  with  the  uncontrouled  influence  which  his  genius  and  virtue  should  entitle  him  to,  entrust entrusted  ed entrusted  with  the  direction  of  our  affairs.  With  the  army,  navy  and  finances  of  the  country  at  his  disposal,  his  soarinrand  comprehensive  mind  would  erect  a  stupendous  fabric  which  we  grow  dizzy►  in  contemplating.  The  present  situation  of  the  enemy  in  Spain  he  would  consider  as  the  most  auspicious  circumstance  which  fortune  has  in  her  power  to  offer;  and  we  form  an  erroneous  opinion  of  the  extent  and  power  of  human  abilities,  if  he  would  not  Cu-  deavour,  by  one  of  those  bold  operations  which  genius  •  alone  can  devise,  to  terminate  at  once  French  rivality  and  opposition.  That  great  Statesman,'  prepared  for  every  occurrence,  would  always  have  our  whole  disposable  force  ready  for  immediate  embarkatiOn,  and  an  adequate  num number  ber number  of  transports  to  convey  them  wherever  their  services  might  be  required.  We  will  not  insult  the  memory  of  that  great  man  by  even  asking  the  question,  if  he  would  have  issued  orders  similar  to  those  reported  to  have  been  sent  by  the  present  Cabinet,  on  receiving  Sir  JOHN  MoonE'S  dispatches.  No  :  his  soul  was  not  to  be  daunted  by  ditli  cultics,  or  surprised  by  rumours  the  moment  he  received  the  intelligence,  a  telegraphic  dispatch  would  have  in instantly  stantly instantly  ordered  to  repair  to  their  destination  the  com commanders  manders commanders  of  our  fleets  and  armies.  But  it  is  useless  as  well  as  impertinent  to  indulge  even  in  a  supposition  of  the  kind  ;  for,  under  an  administration  like  his,  our  arm%  would  not  be  reduced  to  the  mortifying  predicament  of  flying  before  the  enemy.  Instead  of  30  or  35,000  men,  a  :British  force  of  130,000,  conducted  by  a  MaaLnonosen,  (for  talents  create  talents,)  would  have,  a  month  ago,  seized  the  passes  of  the  Pyrenees,  and  shut  up  BONAPARTE  and  his  army  foe  ever  in  Spain.  This  may  be  termed  idle  rant  and  extravagant  speculation.  To  fools  and  cowards,  every  thing  decisive,  and  beyond  the  range  of  their  puny  elmprehension,  is  ridiculed  as  impracticable.  Quitting,  however,  speculations  of  this  nature,  for  what  it  is  now  in  our  power  to  perform,  or  the  Ministers  of  our  time  are  svilling  to  hazard,  we  will  take  the  liberty  of  suggesting,  at  least,  the  necessity  of  removing  the  public  uneasiness,  *-  •  r  row  ritt  4b STYLE=superscript  i  s  ' STYLE=superscript  -  •  *  A- STYLE=superscript  P STYLE=superscript  TITE  .
