As  to  the  immediate  cause  of  the  American  Embargo,  it  must  not  be  contended,  but  that  the  English  Ministry  hue  apparently  committed  the  grossest  errors.  France,  with  the  view  of  destroying  the  English  commerce,  issued  the  Berlin  Decree,  by  which  she  erected  herself  into  the  Sovereip  of  all  neutral  nations,  and  in  this  asserned  cha character  racter character  issued  an  edict  for  putting  a  kingdom  under  block blockade.  ade. blockade.  •  The  promulgation  of  this  Decree  was  certainly  a  most  outrageous  extravagance  of  despotism.  But  it  had  not,  and  indeed  could  not  have,  a  practical  (Sect  commen commensurate  surate commensurate  with  its  Witness  of_  menace.  It  fell,  in  fact,  as  a  tru  Iv  n  J  . STYLE=superscript  :ellen—as  a  thunder-bolt  iu  the  seas,  extinguished  as  soon  us  it-fell.  it  was  in  vain  for  those  to  issue  an  edict  of  bluckaile;  - STYLE=superscript  who  had  no-aliiiii  .ntwnr  to  exccute  their  decree.  The  English  psissesseds  . STYLE=superscript  the  whole  fare  of  the  seas;  and  Neutrals  and  English  might,  therefore,  atilse  have  •  contemned  tlie'Berlin  Order.  Ilere,  therefore,  was  the  main  error  of  the  English  Ministry.  They  looked  rather  to  the  despotism  of  the  De Decree—to  cree—to Decree—to  its  extra  vagaat  insolence  and  haughtiness,  than  to  its  prectical  effect.  If  they  had  considered  only  the  1  latter  quality,  as  in  prudence  they  ought  to  have  done,  they  would  have  passed  the  French  Decree  in  sileut  con contempt--they  tempt--they contempt--they  would  have  deemed  the  contrast  of  its  menace  with  its  imbecility,  as  worthy  only  of  ridicule.  Instead  of  taking  it  in  this  point  of  view,  the  English  Ministry  most  absurdly  regarded  it  only  as  an  outrageous  insult,  and  acting  upon  their  feelings,  instead  of  their  judgments,  retaliated,  as  they  thought,  by  a  limiter  mea measure.  sure. measure.  Passion,  however,  is  usually  too  blind,  and  too  precipitate,  to  distinguish  the  exact  nature  either  of  its  objects  or  of  its  instruments.  And  NO,  in  feet,  it  happened  in  this  ca;e  ;  the  retaliation  was  so  only  in  appearance—it  was,  in  fact,  a  repetition,  an  extension,  at  the  mischief  upon  our  own  heads.  The  enemy  issued  a  decree,  but  could  not  execute  it.  hi  our  precipitate  folly  we  took  the  execution  iu  our  own  hands;  we  literally  swept  the  seas  ;  we  actually  blockaded  France,'  and  by  the  conditions  winch  we  imposed  upon  Neutrals,  prevented  them  erectus  ally  from  coining  to  our  own  Ports.  America,  unable  to  @ell  our  manufactures,  was  very  indifferent  as  to  buying  them.  Her  possible  commerce  was  !hulled  by  what  was  immediately  wanted  by  herself.

The  relations  between  America  and  England  become  so  critical,  and  may  eventually  lead  to  such  important  issues,  that  it  is  incurpbent  upon  us  to  cater  into  some  detail  upon  a  subject  so  generally  interesting.  There  is  something  very  peculiar  in  the  _general  relative  situation  of  America  and  England.  The  two  countries  have-the  same  language,  the  same  general  habits,  and  we  might.  almost  say,  the  same  mind  and  understanding.  The  Americans  are  not  of  the  common  stock,  without  participating  at  the  same  time  in  something  of  the  common  nature.  It  is  .the  characteristic  pride  of  Englishmen  to  think  and  speak  contemptuously  of  other  countries,  and  perhaps,  as  compared  with  our  own,  this  contempt  may  not  be  altogether  so  unreasonable  as  it  may  at  first  appear  ;  but,  to  use  a  vulgar  expression,  it.  I  would  be  defiling._:  our  own  nest,  to  feel  or  express  a  similar  contempt  of  the  Americans.  With  some  peculiar  I  national  habits  superinduced,  they  are  generally  the  same  with  ourselves;  they  have  the•  same  sensibility  under  in insult---they  sult---they insult---they  have  the  same  vices,  and  the  same  virtues.  Our  political  relations  with  America  may  he  considered  t  under  three  heads:—their  origin,  their  actual  state,  and  their  probable  results.  With  respect  to  the  origin'  of  the  present  relative  state  of  America  and  England,  it  may  be  briefly  observed,  that  the  hostile  feeling-  in  the  governments  of  the  two  people  I  are  coeval  with  the  American  Revolution.  Nations  have  I  their  pride,  •as  well  as  individuals.  We  cannot  forget  that  1  America  was  once  our  subject  ;  the  remembrance  rankles  ,  in  our  mind,  and  corrupts  all  the  benevolent  humours  of  our  temper.  We  see  nothing  in  America  but  a  successNl  repel,  and  her  present  tone  of  equality,  as  compared  with  her  former  relations  as  a  dependency,  have  to  us  the  ap appearance.  pearance. appearance.  of.  insolence.  America,  on  the,  other  hand,  feels  naturally  indignant  that  we  refuse  hec  the  rank  and  esti-  Illation  which  belong  to  her;  and  from  this  state  of  feel feelill,  ill, feelill,  and  indeed  of  mutual  acting,  between  the  two,  it  cannot  be  denied,  that  America  and  England  have  uever  been  amicable  at  heart.  The  conduct  of  the  PITT  Minis Ministry,  try, Ministry,  moreover,  which  was  so  long  in  power,  still  further  aggravated  this  original  ill-leven  ;  they  almost  laboriously  insulted  America  even  in  their  diplomatic  appointments.

Their  conduct  was  such  a  reisht  have  been  expected  ;  they  ostentatiously,  and  sumetlines  outrageously,  adopted  the  most  haughty  tone,  and  avenged  their  former  misfortunes  by  their  pre pregent  gent pregent  contempt.

He  recollected  the  glowing  pictures  that  had  been  given  of  the  patriotism  'of  the  'Spaniards,  and  the  exaggeration  of  their  mili military  tary military  force,  which  was  said  to  have  amounted  to  400,000  soldiers,  v.  ith  are  serve  of  more  than  600,000  men.  But  after  lookieg  .over  the  defective  documents  which  had  been  laid  on  the  table  •he  found  that  Lord  W.  Bentinck,  at  the  commencement  of  the•  .contest,  had  sent  the  most  discouraging  accounts  to•  this  country.  As  to  the  spirit  which  %YRS  displayed  by  the  Spa Spaniards,  niards, Spaniards,  he  would  refer  their  Lordships  to  a  letter  of  Sir  John  ;More,  dated  the  21th  of  November,  in  which  he  staled,  that.  it  had  been  entirely  damped  by  their  first  defeats.  In  Mr.  t'rot's  letter  of  the  nth  of  November,  in.  answer  to  Sir  John  Moore,  they  would  find  that  he  described  the  provinces  through  sit  Mich  the  British  army  were  then  passing,  as  the  Last  distio distioguished  guished distioguished  for  patriotic  spirit.  Front  other  testimonies,  his  Lord Lordship  ship Lordship  strongly  suspected  that  that  letter  had  sutfvred  strange  alte alterations;  rations; alterations;  that  passages  had  been  omitted,  and  that  what  now  scented  to  refer  to  one  Small  part  of  the  country  .alone,  in  the  original  extended  to  the  whale  of  Lr.tn  and  both  C:  stile'.

Under  these  circumstances,  he  thought  that  assistance  might  have  been  Skid-.  ed,  but  not  such  a  had  been  sent.

But  how  had  they  disposed  of  the  forces  of  this  tout  try.  They  had  first  sent  Sir  John  Moore,  with  11.,000  men  to  Sweden,  to  assist  that  small  kingdom  against  the  gigantic  power  of  its  assailants,  France,  Russia,  and  Denmark.  But  they  had  sent  Sir  John  Moore,  scarcely  knowing  what  he  should  do,  and  leaving  him  in  total  ignorance  of  their  intentions.  The  digrace digrace'  ' digrace'  ful  result  of  that  expedition  was  well  known.  lie  then  coins  pared  the  conduct  of  Bonaparte,  who  in  three  short  weeks  had  annihilated  all  the  Spanish  artuies,who  were  to  co-operate  with  ours,  and  had.reached  Burgos,  the  point  where  our  troops  were  to  unite  themselves,  before  Sir'  David  Baird  had  begun  his  march  from  Corinn',  and  a  day  before  Sir  John  Moore  lit:cl  entered  Salamanca.  lie  thought  that  the  second  advance  of  the  •  British  army,  when  not  a  single  Spanish  sword  was  raised  in  its  support,  and  toe  greatest  part  of  the  country  was  occupied  by  the  enemy,  14110FC  cavalry  scoured  the  plains  unresisted,  and  raised  contributions  unopposed,  a  measure,  which,  although  dig dignified  nified dignified  by  the  Secretary  of  State  with  the  name  of  useful,  was,  as  its  reshtt  had  proved,  destrective  of  our  best  troops,  and  fatal  to  the  interests  of  Spain.  Had  Sir  John  Moore  retired  to  a  situas  lion  where  he  could  make  a  stand,  the  dispersed  patriots  might  have  gathered  around  hint,  and  raised.  once  inure  the  banner  of  freedom.  The  frontiers  of  Portugal  or  Andalusia  would  halt,  afforded  him  a  Safe  retreat  ;  and  in  the  latter,  the  initireguablF  fortress  of  Gibraltar  would  have  secured  him  a  safe  embarkation.  The  Noble  Secretary  of  State  bad  asserted  that  this  advance  had  been  made  in  consequence  of  Mr.  Frew:4  message;  but  this  was  incredible.  The.  fact  was,  that  Mr.  Frere  was  miserably.  deficient  in  information.  The  Noble  Earl  then  alluded  to  thd  subsequent  correspoudence  of  Mr.  Frere,  to  the  false  infor information  mation information  contained  in  which  he  attributed  .llrno,t  the  whole  of  the  unfortunato  events  which  betel  the  British  Army.

He  observed  that  these  sort-sof  preventive  bills  very  rarely  did  any  good.  As  long  as  temptations  were  sufThred  to  remain,  offences  would  be  committed.  Notwithstanding.  the  provisions  of  such  bills,  the  ingenuity  a  offenders  would  continue  to.  evade  them,  at  a  little  more  ex  pence  or  trouble.  If  the  inquiry  he  had  pro proposed  posed proposed  a  few  nights  since  had  been  gone  into,  there  would  have  been  no  occasion  for  the  present  measure.  As  to  the  othces  con connected  nected connected  with  the  courts  of  law,  he  found  they  had  been  for  a  long  time  regularly  bought  and  sold,  but  he  could  no  reason  why  this  pr:ctice  should  he  suirored  to  continue.  There  was  another  Omission,  however,  in  the  act,  which  appeared  to  him  of  more  material  •  moment.  The  attention  of  the  House  had  been  much  fixed  to  Last  India  w•riterships  and  cadetships,  but  there  was  another  thing  of  much  more  consequence  which  had  not  been  noticed.  It  was  most  notorious  that  there  was  a  traffic  for  other  plAees.,  and  also  for  seats  in  Parliament.—(  Hear  !  hear  !)  This  was  a  thing  most  contrary  to  every  idea  of  the  constitution,  and  vet  it  was  most  notorious  ;  and  as  it  was  most  notoriotv,  -  be  thought  the  Right  [Linton:able  Gentleman  would  do  well  to  introduce  a  clause  in  his  bill  to  prevent  trafficking  for  seats  in  Parlia  , STYLE=superscript  aent.  The  Treasury  was  .the  place  where  this  traffic  went  on•  to  the  greatest  and  most  corrupt  extent.  The  Secre Secretary  tary Secretary  of  tire  Treasury  was  generally  the  agent  in  all  those  trans transactions  actions transactions  on  the  part  of  the  Government,  (  Ilear  !  hear  !  )  ciendetnen  meant  by  this  sneering  to  imply  at  doubt  of  hi-  state statetusat,  tusat, statetusat,  he  ,sktpuld  be  very  happy  to  he  allowed  a  committee  to  exatuitie  into  the  fact.  At  every  dissolution  of  oarliament  there  i%O.s  an  office  open  at  the  trensnry,  where'  the  friends  of  adminis administration  tration administration  stated  theft  terms,  and  where  persons  made  their  bargains  on  differeot  terms,  according  to  the  abilities  with  which  they  were  supposed  capable  of  stipporting  the  Government.  This  svnQitis  firm  belief,  anti  he  believed  it  was  also  the  belief  of  the  pantie..  thought  the  House  should  correct  abuses  of  this  tpagpitude  s  at.  the  same  time  that  they  were  - STYLE=superscript  passing  a  bill  with  respect  to  minor  offences.  Mr,  Creevey  said,  that  the  Noble.  Lord  was  perfectly  correct  in  stating,  that  - STYLE=superscript  seats-in  Parliatnent  had  been  notoriously  bought  and  sold-  by-  the  Treasury.  Ile  would  say,  that  this  - STYLE=superscript  vas  not  wily  Ms  belief,  hut  that  it:  was  within  his  knowledge.  The  Treasury  not  only  openly  bought  and  sold  those  seat,  but  the)  lievt  in  a  great  degree  the  monopoly  of  that  .market.  If  this  Ao,  attempted  to  be  denied  by  Ministers,  he  should  he  glad  to  have  the-opportunity  of  proving  it,  and  he  could  easily  prove  it  from  the  lips  of  any  one  who  had  ever  been  Secretary  of  the  Treasury.  It  was  absolute  -nonsense  and  delusion  On  the  public,  for  the  House  to  spend  their  time  in  considering  abuses  in  the  Commis Commissioners  sioners Commissioners  of  the  Lottery,  and  every  oilier  minor  department,  when  they  knew,  and  when  the  public  k'ww,  that  the  greatest  of  all  atuscs  was  constantly  practised  b)  every  Secretary  of  the  Treasury.  in  buying  and  selling  seats  in  Parliament.  To  talk  of  a  dissolution  of  Parliament  as  an  appeal  to  the  people  was  mere  mockery  and  imposition.  It  was  perfectly  well  known  that  a  dissolution  of  Parliament  was  not  tin  appeal  to  the  peo people,  ple, people,  but  to  the  Treasury  (Hear!  Rear  !)  Although  he  had  great  respect  tar  the  last  Goverment,  and  owed  some  personal  favours  to  them,  Set  he  must  say,  that  their  dissolution  of  Par Parliament  liament Parliament  at  the  end  of  four  years,  like  the  dissolution  by  the  present  Ministers,  at  the  end  of  about  four  months,  was  not  nn  appeal  to  the  people  but  to  the  Treasury  (loud  cries  of  Hear  !

The  attack  on  the  Brest  Fleet  was  made  on  the  llth  of  April,  at  eight  o'clock  in  the  evening.  The  attacking  squadron,  as  it  would  appear  by  the  Gazette,  for  this  offi official  cial official  narrative  is  in  some  degree  confused,  consisted  of  two  divisions,--the  covering  squadron  of  Lord  COCURANE,  and  he  fire-ships  led  on  by  Capt.  WootnninGE,  in  the  Mediator.  The  Wind  blowing  from  the  Northward  impelled  them,  of  coarse  on  the  enemy,who  were  anchored  to  the  Southward,  and  the  freshness  of  it,  together  with  the  consequent  heavy  sea,  gave  a  momentum  to  the  Mediator,  which  enabled  it  to  break  the  boom,  or  chain,  by  which  the  approach  to  the  enemy's  fleet  was  defended.  The  French  forts  and  shipping  opposed  the  assault  by  a  very  heavy  fire,  but  the  bravery  of  the  British  seamen  overcame  all  obstacles,  and  compelled  the  enemy  to  run.  their  vessels  on  shore.—Seven  of  their  vessels  accordingly  grounded,  five  of  which,  however,  got  into  the  Charente  before  day-light.  On  the  following  day,  the  12th,  about  two  o'clock,  Lord  CocKaANE  led  the  attack  in  the  lmperieuse,  and  opened  his  fire  on  the  Calcutta,  which  very  speedily  struck  her  colours  ;  the  Yille  de  Varsovie  and  the  Aquilon,  were  then  successively  attacked,  and  successively  surrendered.  The  prisoners  were  removed,  and  they  were  set  on  fire.  The  enemy  themselves  destroyed  the  Tonnerre,  seeing  it  impos impossible  sible impossible  to  save  it.  The  Vile  de  Varsovie  was  a  80  gun,  the  Tonnerre  a  64,  the  Aquillon  a  74,  and  the  Calcutta  a  56.  On  the  night  of  the  12th  another  attempt  was  made  to  fire  the  *ships  on  shore,  but  from  the  shallowness  of  the  water  it  was  deemed  more  prudent  to  abandon  it.  The  vessels  likewise  which  had  escaped  into  the  Charente,  were  separated  beyond  the  reach  of  present  attack.  The  Gazette  here  concludes  with  a  well  merited  compli.  ment  to  Lord  Cocriamsc,  who  certainly  seems  to  be  tread treading  ing treading  in  the  steps  of  the  lamented  NELSON,  and  who,  if  Pro Providence  vidence Providence  shall  preserve  his  life,  will  doubtless  obtain  the  same  eminence  of  glory  and  reputation.

There  is  no  languor,  no  reluctance;  no  despair  of  the  public  cause,  either  in  our  fleets  or  in  out  armies  ;  our  soldiers  and  sailors  go  forth  in  the  full  assur assurance  ance assurance  of  victory,  and  this  laudable  assurance,  this  noble  confidence,  enables  them  to  accomplish  their  expectations.  Long  may  this  spirit  continue,  for  so  long  will  otir  country  not  only  be  safe,  but  glorious.  The  result  of  this  glorious  affair  therefore  is,  that  the  lii-est  fleet  has  disappeared  from  the  surface  of  the.  seas  ;  fir::  sail  have  been  destroyed,  three  driven  on  shore,  and  the  commander  of  the  fleet  compelled  to  run  into  the  Cha Charente,  rente, Charente,  which  is  certainly  not  either  a  safe  or  a'  favourable  station,  or  .

We  never  remember  an  occasion,  in  which  the  town  was  more  animated,  in  which  the  success  was  Thore  and  had  so  little  to  alloy  it.  WAR  BETWEEN  AUSTRIA  AND  FRANCE.  What  we  had  foreseen,  indeed,  what  we  have  dreaded,  has  at  length  occurred,  and  after  years  of  vacillation,  of  alternate  decision  and  irresolution,  of  menace  on  one  side,  and  an  equivocal  submission  on  the  other,  France  and  Austria  are  again  committed,  and  have  again  resorted  to  the  last  appeal  of  nations.  This  resort,  in  whatever  point  of  view  it  is  to  be  considered,  is  of  a  most  important  nature,  and  may  eventually  lead  to  consequences  which  may  again  entirely  vary  the  face  of  Europe.  The  calamities  of  the  Continent,  and  the  passive  submission  which  resulted  from  them,  had  began  to  give  an  air  of  tranquillity  :  there  were  certainly  murmurs,  and  perhaps  curses,  not  lotul.  but  deep,  but  people  seemed  reconciled  to  their  degradation,•  and  as assumed  sumed assumed  at  least  the  external  appearance  of  a  patient  expec expectation  tation expectation  of  better  times.  Austria  has  at  length  taken  her  resolution,  and  .whatever  there  is  of  the  disaffected  and  turbulent,  must  now  rally  around  her.  The  Austrian  proclamation  is  very  strongly  characterised  with  the  present  actual  disposition  of  Austria,—with  her  hopes  and  her  fears,—with  her  desperate  effort  and  with  her  due  sense  of  its  perilous  nature.  The  Archduke  CIIARLES  is  too  great  a  General  not  to  know  the  peril  to  which  he  puts  his  country—he  too  welt  understands  the  relative  situation  of  France  and.  Austria,  to  have  any  other  hopes,  but  on  the  most  valiant  efforts  of  a  united  nation  and  soldiery,  seconded  by  that  assistance  which  Providence,  in  an  honest  cause,  often  bestows  on  the  weak  when  opposed  to  the  strong.  It  would  be  uncandid  in  the  most  extreme  degree,  to  congratulate  the  British  public  on  an  event  which  at  best  is  perilous  in  the  extreme.  We  have  never  dealt  in  such  general  delusion,  and  we  will  not  now  begin.  Austria  has  our  wishes,  our  most  ardent  hopes;  .  but  our  hopes  are  trembling,  and  our  Wishes  are  blended  with  our  apprehensions.  We  feel  for  Austria,  as,  in  simi similar  lar similar  circumstances,  we  should  feel  for  ourselves.  Our  feel feelings,  ings, feelings,  on  such  an  occasion,  should  not  depress  our  energy— energywe  we energywe  would  do  all  that  we  could,  and  look  to  the  protecting  hand  of  Heaven  to  second  our  efforts.  There  are  one  or  two  circumstances  in  favour  of  Austria.  In  the  first  place,  the  German  Confederacy,  at  present  in  alliance,  indeed  in  actual  incorporation  with  France,  may  -very  naturally  be  presumed  to  have  more  sympathy  for  Austria,  than  for  the  Emperor  NAPOLCON.  This  Confede Confederacy  racy Confederacy  was  very  skilfully  put  together  by  France;  hut  it  was  put  together  at  a  time  and  period  when  Austr:a  was  in  a  different  situation  to  what  she  now  exhibits.  Austria,  powerful  and  ambitious,  the  supreme  power  in  Germany,  was  an  object  of  terror,  and  therefore  of  envy,  to  all  the  other  German  Princes.  They  were  pleased,  therefore,  to  see  her  humbled,  and  in  the  moment  of  the  gratification  of  their  envy  forgot  the  interests  of  their  own  safety.  They  forgot  that  if  Austria,  by  her  superior  relative  power,  trespassed  on.  them  herselt,—if  she  occasionally  assumed  a  tone,  and  perhaps  an  active  power,  which  was  contrary  to  their  privileges,—they  forgot,  we  say,  that  she  was  enabled  by  the  same  power  to  become  their  protector,  that  she  was  their  natural  barrier  against  foreigners,  and  thateven  a  state  of  jealousy  and  domestic  rivalry  with  a  powerful  neighbour,  was  better  than  absolute  subjection  under  •a,  'foreigner.  They  forgot  this  at  the  time,  but  have  doubtless  become  wiser  by  experience.  Austria,  therefore,  may  look  with  expectation  to  this  quarter,  and  it  is  evident  that  she  enter entertains  tains entertains  these  hopes  from  the  very  language.  of  the  Procla Proclamaim  maim Proclamaim  •  .i  Year  lrlnotshnti  ;  never  Clow  for  Foreign  interests  and  Fo Foreign  reign Foreign  nointousisests.  not  on  you  shall  the  curse  alight  to  annihi annihilate  late annihilate  innocent  pations;•  and  over  the  bodies  of  the  slaughtered  de defenders  fenders defenders  of  their  coniitry  to  pave  the  way  fur  a  foreigner  to  the  usurped  throne.

The  personal  abilities  of  the  Archduke  Cnantik;may  awaken  a  reasonable  hope,  that  whatever  can  be  done  bf  human  effort,  will  be•done  by  him.

Andrewes  accordingly  reprobated  the  churching  of  women  in  private  houses.  Setting  aside  the  irreverence  of  this  practice  ,  it  is  clear  that  those  who  adopt  it,  and  the  slumber  of  them  is  by  far  too  great,  utterly  confound  together  places  distinct  as  churches  and  houses  ;  for  the  Thanksgiving  of  Women  after  Child-birth,'  conducted  thus  privately,  is  housing  rather  than  churching  women.  wish  it  were  for  me  to  agree  with  Dr.  Andrewes  in  other  things.  There  are  cases,  however,  in  which  it  is  better  to  chew  the  eligibility,  instead  of  insisting  on  the  necessity,  of  our  church  forms.  What  is  always  physically  right.  may  sometimes  he  poli politically  tically politically  wrong  ;  an:l  it  was  scarcely  possible  to  hear  Dr.  Andre:Wes  expatiaLing  on  the  biessings  of  fathering  a  nume numerous  rous numerous  progeny,  as  matters  now  stand,  without  fe,Tsig  come  trivial  objections  to  the  persuasion  which  he  -so  happily  laboured  to  disseminate.  Patriarchal  precedents  were  the  last  that  should  have  been  cited  in  confirmation  of  the  generative  benediction.  When  Lot  was  able  to  choose  i.`ocioni,  and  Abraham  to  settle  in  Canaan,  either  for  him himself,  self, himself,  each  might  feel  the  advantage  of  replenishine;  the  .earth  ;  but  we,  who  live  where  hemen  affairs  ace  not  ex exactly  actly exactly  in  the  same—state,  must  calculate  before  we  pro procreate,  create, procreate,  and  are  not  entitled  to  expect  that  the  goodness  of  providence  will  relieve  the  folly  of  our  improvidence.  Could  our  children  always  possess  the  gates  of  ti;(;se,  that  kite  them,  then,  as  under  the  first  law,  might  our  off offspring,  spring, offspring,  after  honoring  their  fathers  and  mothers,  rise  up  to  bless  us.

There  was  one  part  of  his  discourse,  however,  which  00.41  it  to  be  pointed  out,  and  to  which  praise  is  most  jristf;  due.  Adverting  to  fashionable  funeraN,  he  eneri..st  ically  remon remonstrated  strated remonstrated  against  the  practice,  still  so  prevalent  in  high  life,  of  persons  celebrating  the  obsequies  of  their  relations  as  it  were  by  proxy  ;  so  that  servants,  in  this  last  sad  rite,  be become  come become  the  substitutes  of  masters,  and  funerals  are  literally  performed.  Nothing  can  be  more  revolting  than  thi4  practice.  It  is  insult  to  the  deceased,  it  is  scandal  to  the  living.  Abraham  himself  buried  Sarah  ;  and  the  principal  personages  of  Egypt  consentancously  accompanied  Joseph  to  the  burial  of  Jacob.  It  was  over  a  grave  that  Jesus  wept.  Humanity  is  to  be  acquired  at  the  bed  of  sickness,  and  piety  at  the  interment  of  the  dead.  What  is  the  tomb,  to  those  who  can  truly  ask,  agreeably  to  The  order  for  the  Burial  of  the  Dead,'  the  speedy  accomplishment  of  the  number  of  the  and  who  feel  heartily  thankful,  at  the  same  time.  that  the  souls  of  them  they  love  are  delivered  from  the  burden  of  the  and  from  the  misnies  of  this  sinful  world  Of  our  future  knowledge  of  each  other,  what  may  he  termed  individual  recognition  beyond  the  grave,  of  this  hope,  to  which  reason  aspires  and  which  revelation  coun countenances,  tenances, countenances,  Dr.  Andrews  did  not  speak.  Scarcely  did  he  venture  on  the  confines  of  that  state  where  the  souls  of  them  that  depart  .exist  in  joy  and  felicity  It  was  rather  trivial  in  him,  after  this  neglect,  to  censure  those  simple  creatures,  who,  instead  of  attending  to  the  solemnities  of  burial,  are  drawn  thither  by  admiring  the  proud  pall,  or  seen  noticing  the  curious  coffin.  Knowing  the  important  impressions  often  made  both  on  the  heart  and  mind  by  the  burial  of  the  dead,  religiously  celebrated,  1  greatly  regret  the  too  frequent  neglect  of  carrying  the  corps:  into  the  church  ;  where  the  sacredness  of  the  place,  and  the  portion  of  divine  scripture  usually  read,  most  fitly  prepare  the  mourners  for  the  final  solem solemnity  nity solemnity  of  committit2;  the  bony  of  the  deceased  to  the  grave.  Parsimony  is  the  last  feeling  that  should  be  con-  I  stilted  in  this  particular  ;  and  where  poverty  really  operates  to  the  exclusion  of  piety,  well  would  it  become  the  minister  of  •relig,rion,  remembering  to  Whom  he  is  responsible,  to  dispense,  in  some  shape,  with  the  church  fees  otherwise  to  he  expected.  Something  should  be  done  on  this  subject.

Godfrey,  of  the  /Etna,  in  bombarding  the  enemy's  ships  on  th*  12th,  and  nearly  all  the  day  of  the  13th,  if  I  did  not  recommend  him.  to  their  Lordships'  notice.;  and  I  cannot  omit  hearing  due  testimony  to  the  anxious  desire  expressed  by  Mr.  Congrece  to.  he  employed  wherever  I  might  , STYLE=superscript  conceive  his  services  in  - STYLE=superscript  the  I  management  of  hi  3  rockets  would  be  useful  ;  some  of  theft  were.  placed  in  the  tire-ships  with  effect  ;  and  I  have  every  reason  to  he  saCsSed  with  the  artillerymen,  and  others,  who  had  the  management  of  them  under  Mr.  Congreve's  direction.  I  send  herewith  a  return  of  the  killed,  wounded,  and  mlssinf  s  of  the  fleet,  which,  1  am  happy  to  observe,  is  comparatively  •  •  small.  I  have  not  yet  received  the  returns  of  the  number  of  prisoners  taken,  but  I  conceive  they  amount  to  between  four  and  fi-..e  hundred.  I  have  charged  Sir  Harry  Neale  %;•1!h  this  dispatch  (by  the  Iraperieuse),  and  I  beg  ;rave  to  refer  their  Lordships  to  him,  as  also  to  Lord  Cochrane,  for  any  further  particulars  of  which  they  may  wish  to  he  infarnit  d.
