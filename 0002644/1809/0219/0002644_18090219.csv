For  shame  !  for  shame!  we  can  never  believe  it.  The  idea  is  too  extravagant.  The  letters  arc  unquestionably  fictitious.

The  English  army  had  landed  more  than  BO  pieces  of  cannon  ;  only  12  were STYLE=superscript  re-embarked  :  the  remainder  has  been  taken  or  lost  ;  and  by  a  return  made,  we  find  ourselves  in  possession  of  60  pieces  of  English  cannon.  Independent  or  two  millions  of  treasure  the  army  has  taken  from  the  English,  it  appears  that  a  treasure  inure  considerable  has  been  cast  away  among  the  rocks  and  precipices  which  border  the  road  from  A•i A•i-torga  torga A•i-torga  to  Corunna.

In  the  engagements  'which  took  place  during  the  retreat,  and  prior  to  the  battle  of  Corunna,  two  English  Generals  were  killed,  and  three  wounded.  General  Crawford  is  named  among  the  last.  The  English  have  lost  every  thing  that  constitutes  an  army—Generals,  artillery,  horses,  baggage,  ammunition,  magazines.  On  the  17th,  at  day daybreak,  break, daybreak,  we  were  masters  of  the  heights  that  command  the  road  to  Corunna,  and  the  batteries  were  playing  upon  the  English  con convoy.  voy. convoy.  The  result  was,  that  many  of  the  ships  were  unable  to  get  out,  and  were  taken  at  the  capitulation  of  Corunna.  Five  hun hundred  dred hundred  English  horses  were  also  taken  still  alive,  16,000  muskets,  and  a  great  deal  of  battering  cannon,  abandoned  by  the  enemy.  A  great  number  of  magazines  are  full  of  preserved  provisions  (munition  confectiones),  which  the  English  wished  to  carry  oil,  but  were  obliged  to  leave  behind.  A  powder  magazine,  contain containing  ing containing  200,0001b5.  weight  of  powder,  has  also  fallen  into  our  hands.  The  English,  surprised  by  the  issue  of  the  battle  of  the  16th,  have  not  even  had  time  to  destroy  their  magazines.  There  were  300  English  sick  in  the  Hospital.  We  found  in  the  port  seven  English  ships—three  loaded  with  horses,  and  four  with  troops.  They  could  not  get  out.  The  fortress  of  Corunna  is  of  an  e  xtent  which  secures  it  from  a  coup  de  main.  It  was  therefore  impossible  to  enter  it  before  the  20th,  in  virtue  of  the  annexed  capitulation.  In  Corunna  we  found  above  200  pieces  of  Spanish  cannon.  The  French  Consul  Fourcroy,  the  General  Ouesnel,  and  his  Staff;  M.  Bougars,  Officer  of  Ordnance;  M.  Taboureau,  Auditor;  and  3.50  French  soldiers  or  seamen,  who  had  been  made  prisoners  either  in  Portugal  or  on  board  the  ship  Atlas,  have  been  delivered  up.  They  express  great  Satisfaction  at  the  conduct  of  the  Officers  of  the  Spanish  Navy.  The  English  will  have  gained  by  their  expedition  the  hatred  of  the  Spaniards,  shame,  and  dishonour.  The  flower  of  their  army,  composed  of  Scotchmen,  has  been  either  wounded,  killed,  or  taken.  General  Franceschi  has  entered  St.  Jago  de  Compostella,  where  he  found  some  magazines  and  an  English  guard,  which  he  took.

The  first  care  of  the  Duke  of  Dalmatia  has  been  to  provide  for  the  restoration  of  salubrity,  equally  important  to  the  soldiers-  and  the  inhabitants.

It  would,  be  said,  be  in  their  Lordships  recollection,  that  in  con consequence  sequence consequence  of  the  sentiments  felt  and  expressed  by  every  clas  of  merchants  and  manufacturers  in  this  kilidaMl,  he  had,  on  a  former  occasion,  distinctly  ..,o1  fully  stated  his  opinions  and  his  argu arguments  ments arguments  upon  the  question,  which  this  night  his  duty  galled  up  o  n  him  again  to  bring  before  their  Lordships-1  question  involvi  n  g  not  merely  the  commercial  and  fiaancial  interests,  but  the  politi political  cal political  and  moral  justice,  nay,  in  its  ultimate  effects,  the  safety,  per perhaps  haps perhaps  the  existence  of  the  Empire.  From  the  authentic  and  printed  documents  upon  their'  Lordships'  table,  he  would  make  it  manifest  to  every  Noble  Lord  who  heard  him,  that,  so  far  from  unfairness,  or  partiality,  exhibited  on  the  part  of  America  against  this  country,  and  in  favour  of  France,  nothing  could  pos possibly  sibly possibly  be  more  fair  or  impartial,  excep:,  imleed,  w  hat  his  Lord Lordship  ship Lordship  maintained  was  truly  the  case,  a  partiality,  and  a  very  im important  portant important  one,  in  favour  of  this  country.  Here  his  Lordship  read  the  instructions  sent  by  the  American  Government  to  Mr.  Armstrong  in  Paris,  :LA  to  Mr.  Pinckney  in  London,  whereby  it  appeared  that  the  proposal  to  this  Govern Government  ment Government  was  that,  on  the  part  of  America,  the  Embargo  should  he  suspended,  provided  we  would  reseiud  the  Orders  in  Council;  and  this  being  agreed  upon,  it  was  added,  that  she)  mid  France  refuse  to  cancel  her  decrees,  she  must  necessarily  draw  upon  herself  the  hostility  of  America.  The  same  proposition,  and  in  the  same  terms,  was  made  to  the  Government  of  France;  so  that  here  was  a  fair  opportunity  of  not  only  conciliating  the  American  States,  and  restoring  the  good  understanding,  and  the  solid  advantages  from  it  resulting  to  both  countries,  but  a  strong  probability  was  afforded  of  a  cordial  and  ;:etive  co-operation,  by  a  powerful  Ally,  in  prosecuting  war  agaitist  the  common  enemy.  flis  Lordship  reprobated,  in  very  strong  terms,  the  conduct  of  Ministers,  which  appeared  to  have  been  suggested  by  no  motive  of  wisdom,  justice,  or  policy,  but  to  grow  oat  of  a  principle  of  petty  and  despicable  pride.

He  had  heard  of  the  connection,  and  knew  that  Mrs.  Sinclair  had  represented  herself  as  being  with  child  by  the  Duke  of  York.—lle  was  then  requested  to  state,  whether  he  had  ever  solicited  this  lady  to  get  a  troop  for  a  friend  of  his?  Which  he  denied.  Whether  any  large  suM.of  money  had  been  paid  by  the  Duke  of  York  to  Mrs.  Clarke  through  witness's  hands  ?

WitneSs  produced  them,  and  they  were  read  aloud,  but  contained  nothing  remarkable.  He  was  then  desired  to  state  when  he  had  become  acquainted  with  Major  Turner,  and  whether  that  officer  informed  him  of  his  reasons  for  resigning  ?  lie  replied  that  in  1803  he  had  become  acquainted  with  the  Major,  and  that  the  reason  he  gave  for  resigning  was,  his  having  got  into  an  un unfortunate  fortunate unfortunate  scrape  with  some  woman,  whose  name  he  never  had  mentioned.  That  he  was  about  to  state  that  reason  to  the  Com Commander  mander Commander  in  Chief,  but  that  witness  advised  him  not,  as  he  did  not  think  it  necessary  that  the  private  affairs  of  officers  should  be  revealed  on  such  an  occasion.  He  was  next  interrogated  as  to  the  credit  attached,  in  the  Commander  in  Chief's  office,  to  ano anonymous  nymous anonymous  letters  ;  and  replied  that  they  were  always  attended  to  in  a  proper  way.

When  asked,  whether  Samuel  Carter  was  in  the  habit  of  dining  at  Captain  Sutton's  table,  he  declared  his  total  ignorance,  as  he  himself  had  never  (lined  with  that  other.  lie  was  then  ordered  to  withdraw,  and  the  Speaker  having  reported  progress,  the  House  adjourned.

Every  persom,  who  has  been  on  the  spot,  and  whose  observations  are  of  some  authority,  acknowledge  that  no  people  ever  breathed  a  more  ardent  love  of  their  country,  displayeti-more  fervour  in  the  cause,  Ulan  the  inhabitants  of  Andalusiet.  To  provide,  however,  against  the  possible  consequences  of  defeat,  measures  have  been  taken  to  secure  the  French  and  the  Spanish  fleets  at  Cadiz,  which  were  to  be  conveyed  to  the  outer  port.  We  are  happy  to  state,  upon  undeniable  authority,  that  the  inhabitants  of  that  city  display  the  greatest  activity  in  augmenting  their  measures  of  defence.  The  spirit  which  pervades  the  great  body  of  the  people  is  excellent  ;  and  the  intrigues  of  Mont,.;  produced  no  other  effect  than  to  strengthen  their  resolution  of  defending  their  city  to  the  last  extremity.  The  late  supply  from  Vera-Cr►►z,  of  9,200,003  dollars,  cannot  fail  to  increase  the  confidence  pf  the  Patriots.  It  is  one  of  those  unexpected  propi-  Onus  circumstances,  which,  in  a  mo►nent  of  gloom  and  trouble,  raises  the  spirits  of  men,  from  extreme  depression  to  above  the  ordinary  level.

The  mind,  relaxed  by  a  continuation  of  disappointments,  instantly  collects  itself,  and,  as  if  ashamed  of  its  former  despondency,  displays,  and  feels  a  more  than  usual  energy.  Previous,  however,  to  the  arrival  of  this  pecuniary  supply,  measures  of  caution,  as  well  as  vigour,  were  unceasingly  resorted  to.  A  number  of  persons,  suspected  of  favouring  the  designs  of  the  enemy,  and  of  maintaining  a  secret  cor correspondence  respondence correspondence  with  MoaLs,  were  arrested  ;  and  the  French  prisoners  were  to  be  transported  to  the  Balearic  Islands.

AFTER  the  accounts  we  continue  to  receive,  through  vari various  ous various  directions,  and  from  unobjectionable  eye-witnesses,  of  the  unabating  ardour  and  spirit  of  resistance  manifested  by  the  great  majority  of  the  Spanish  nation,  it  cannot  fail  to  excite  astonishment,  that  the  result  of  their  efforts  has  been  hitherto  so  unpropitious;  and  that  a  numerous  population,  animated  with  the  courage  and  enthusiasm  they  unquestionably  displa3-  ed,  was  nevertheless  incapable  of  affording  a  more  effectual  re resistance.  sistance. resistance.  We  will  attempt  to  explain  this  difficulty.  As.soOn  as  Bonaparte  had  succeeded  in  disuniting  the  unfortunate  Royal  Family  of  Spain,  and  in  getting  afterwards  these  victims  of  his  treachery  and  intrigues  into  his  power,  his  first  step  was  to  secure  by  promises,  or  intimidation,  the  persons  of  the  most  distinguished  characters  iu  that  country.  They  were,  iu  like  manner,  transported,  or  ordered  to  repair  to  Bayonne.  In  the  mean  time,  the  inhabitants  of  most  of  the  provinces  rose,  spontaneously  and  unexpectedly  to  resent  the  unparalleled  out outrage.  rage. outrage.  New  men  immediately  appeared  to  guide  and  direct  the  efforts  of  the  inhabitants  and  to  fill  the  vacancies,  which  had  been  occasioned  by  the  absence  of  those  who  had  formerly  the  administration  of  the  provinces,  and  had  filled  the  principal  places  under  Government.

They  bad  the  means  of  fomenting  and  keeping  the  popular  indignation  alive;  but  were  not  vested  with  sufficient  authority  to  exact  and  enforce  from  their  fellow-citizens,  the  performance  of  those  duties,  and  a  submission  to  those  privations,  which  resistance  on  a  large,  habitual,  and  uniform  scale  necessarily  demanded  e—a  resist resistance  ance resistance  sufficient  to  oppose  the  undivided  strength  of  the  French  empire,  guided  by  au  active,  vigilant,  versatile,  and  intelligent  Chieftain,  possessing,  in  the  highest  degree,  the  confidence  of  his  troops,  enjoying  the  reputation  of  uniform  success,  judici judicious,  ous, judicious,  beyond  any  comparison,  in  the  choice  of  his  expedients,  and  prompt,  to  a  degree  before  unparalleled,  in  their  employ employment.  ment. employment.

The  same  admirable  order  prevails  in  the  civil  administration  ;  so  that  a  single  word,  the  slightest  enunciation  of  his  will,  is  sufficient  to  give  vigour  and  rapidity  to  every  wheel,  to  the  most  trifling  spring  of  the  immense  machine  which  he  directs.—To  oppose  success successful  ful successful  and  continued  resistance  to  such  a  man  the  new  leaders  did  not  possess  sufficient  talents,  experience,  authority,  or  confidence.

The  perform performance  ance performance  of  all  this  was  very  practicable,  and  completely  within  the  circle  of  Spanish  resources,  local,  moral,  and  political.

The  invaders  were  in  small  corps  of  from  ten  to  fifteen  thousand  men;  unacquainted  with  the  country  and  destitute  of  provisions.  Under  these  circumstances  the  provinces,  even  with  their  con contracted  tracted contracted  means,  had  it  certainly  in  their  power  to  overwhelm  the  enemy.

From  that  moment  the  plan  of  operations  was  totally  altered.  The  provinces,  calculated  only  on  their  individual  resources.  They  had  their  respective  interests,  their  leaders,  their  Juntas,  and  their  armies  ;  but  there  existed  no  unity  of  action  and  con concert  cert concert  of  will  in  the  whole  Body  ;  and  as  there  was  no  individual,  or  Junta,  who  possessed  any  power,  influence,  or  confidence  beyond  their  own  province,  it  was  impossible,  all  at  once,  to  reconcile  the  different  interests,  to  efface  provincial  .  jealousies,  and  to  impress  the  importance  of  unanimity.  The  abominable  corruption,  impotence,  and  favoritism  of  the  late  government,  'the  treasonable  practices  of  the  Prince  of  the  Peace,  an:  the  exactions  of  the  subordinate  minions,  left  the  Arsenals  without  military  stores,  and  the  public  coffers  without  money.

The  emissaries  who  have  been  sent  into  different  parts  of  Austria  report,  that  no  movements  of  any  consequence  have  hitherto  taken  place  among  the  troops.  The  Marquis  of  Campo  Chiaro  is  waiting  here  for  fresh  .orders,  and  it  appears  that  the  accession  of  his  Majesty  King  Joachim  to  the  throne  of  Naples,  has  been  made  known  to  the  'Court  of  Vienna  much  later  than  had  been  supposed,  for  which  .reason  the  Above  Minister  cannot  proceed  to  that  capital,  until  the  Court  has  returned  an  Letters  from  Cadiz  slate,  that  the  Junta  at  Seville  had  sent  an  Envoy  to  the  King  of  Morocco,  to  procure  a  supply  of  horses,  find  that  the  request  was  to  1w  complied  with,  on  condition  .that  the  Spanish  Government  would  agree  to  evacuate  and  demolish  all  the  forts  held  by  their  troops  in  Africa.

With  respect  to  the  defence  of  Cadiz,  should  the  attack  of  the  enemy  take  place,  strong  hopes  are  entertained  that  it  would  call  forth  the  most  ardent  loyalty.

Did  the  Duke  of  York  re represent  present represent  the  note  to  you  iu  the  same  light  that  he  did  to  Colonel  Gordon  ?  A.  When  l  first  made  the  communication  to  the  Duke  of  York  on  Saturday  the  4th  of  lebruar,•,  he  declared,  without  hesitation,  that  he  had  no  recollection  whatever  of  such  a  note,  and  that  it  mast  be  a  forgery.  When  I  went  with  him,  on  the  same  evening,,  to  Mr.  Perceval's  house,  he  made  an  asseveration  precisely  to  the  same  effect;  and  afterwards,  when  I  went  from  Mr.  Percetal'4  to  Cohort  Gordon's,  he  made  a  similar  assertion  to  that  w  hick  Colonel  Gorden  has  given  in  evidence.
