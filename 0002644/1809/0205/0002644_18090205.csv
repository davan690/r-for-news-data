But  this.  madness  is  almost  peculiar  to  our  age.  The  duties  forninrly  imposed  on  the  members  of  a  community,  allowed  them  neither  time,  nor  leisure,  to  indulge  in  such  speculations:—They  were  satisfied  to  serve  their  country  ;  and  they  performed  that  service  with  a  zeal,  an  ardour,  a  disinterestedniss,  which  we  condemn  as  romantic,  reject  as  prosperity  of  the  community  proved,  however,  the  siiperiorit)  of  practical,  over  speculative  pa patriotism  triotism patriotism  :  And  iY  au  enthusiastic  leveller,  or  an  ambitious  demagogue,  urged  the  necessity  of  innovation,  they  fell,  almost  invariably,  victims  to  their  mistaken  zeal,  or  crimi criminal  nal criminal  restlessness  ;  ,for  t%e  people  loved  their  institutions  too  ardently,  with  too  much  veneration,  as  to  consent  to  their  becoming  the  sport  of  novelty  or  passion.

I  am  unwilling,  Sir,  to  press  this  question  on  yogi  too  far;  because  l  sincerely  admire  your  talents,  and  venerate  your  private  virtues.  You  should  not  forget,  however,  the  encouragement  which  the  sanction  of  your  name  and  merit  gives  to  those  miserable  and  unprincipled.  wretches,  who,  without  talents  and  virtue,  have  no  pretensions  to  c  notice,  than  by  a  systematic  attack  of  every  thing  great  in  point  of  theory,  venerable  for  its  antiquity,  or  cemmendable  for  its  use.

I  deplore,  however,  the  existence  of  those  fatal  passions  which  can  extort  from  an  honest  man  a  confession,  disapproved  by  his  conscience,  and  contrary  to  his  conviction.  Declarations  of  thin  kind,  even  if  true,  are  attended  with  no  possible  benefit,  but  may  be  produc productive  tive productive  of  signal  disadvantage;—as  they  tend  to  delude  and  dispirit  a  numerous  and  highly  useful  class  of  the  public.  Contrast,  Sir,  your  disheartening  sentiment,  with  the  manly  and  inspiring  principles  of  Mr.  CANNING  ;  which,  were  they  as  erroneous  as  they  are  founded  on  the  immutable  prin principles  ciples principles  oftruth,  justice,  and  sound  policy,  would  be  capable  of  creating  a  degree  of  spirit  and  constancy,  more  than  suf sufficient  ficient sufficient  to  counteract  the  danger  they  may  occasion.

But  that  part  of  your  conduct,  which  appears  to  me  most  unintelligible,  and  least  capable  of  defence,  is  the  pertinacity  with  which  you  insist  on  the  expediency  of  ne negotiating  gotiating negotiating  with  the  enemy.  This  is  a  subject  of  such  vast  importance,  and  embraces  so  many  and  such  complicated  interests,  that  it  impresses  a  more  than  ordinary  seriousness,  and  excites  an  accountable  sensation  as  often  as  we  refer  to  it.

FEB.  5.  The  CDANCELLOR  of  the  EXCIEEQUER  conceived  that  the.  charge  ought  to  be  proceeded  on  by  the  Committee.  It  might  probably  become  t  future  question,  and  a  serious  consideration,  to  know  when  and  on  iv  hat  grounds  the  House  was  originally  , STYLE=superscript  called  upon  to  entertain  it.  Mr.  WA  RDLD  wished  to  acquiesce  in  the  general  wishes  of  the  Committee,  either  to  withdraw  or  to  proceed  with  the  charge.  It  was  pornsible  that  in  the  warmth  of  discussion  he  might  have  stated  in  this  charge  something  stronger  than  the  ease  admitted.  But  on  referring  - STYLE=superscript  to  his  own  notes  he  had  no  idea  to  make  any  other  impression  than  that  which  he  himself  felt  on  the  rapid  promotion  of  Captain  Mating  over  deserving  officers,  his  seniors.  in  the  army.  40  Colonel  GottooN  examined  by  Mr.  WARDLE.  Colonel  Go  it  DON  stated,  that  Captain  Mating  was  in  Norem-•  her,  1805,  on  the  recommendation  of  Sir  John  Doyle,  appointed  to  an  ensigncy  in  the  i;7th  regiment.  On  the  24th  of  July',  18(38,  an  application  was  made  by  Major-General  Frazer  to  the  COM;  wander  in  Chief,  requesting  his  Royal  Highness  - STYLE=superscript  that  he  might  he  allowed  to  appoint  Lieutenant  Maling  his  aid-de-camp.  The!  regiment  in  which  that:oilicer  was,  being  under  orders  for  em embarkation,  barkation, embarkation,  and  as  it  was  inconsistent  with  the  .  lionour  of  the  set-  . STYLE=superscript  vice,  he  did  not  quit  his  regiment.  lint  soon  :dirt-,  when  the  African  corps  was  augmented  from  four  to  six  companies,  Lieu Lieutenant  tenant Lieutenant  Mating  was  recommended  for  one  of  the  new  companies.  Colonel  Gordon,  however,  first  had  an  interview  with  Captain  Maling's  brother,  in  which  he  intimated  to  him,  that  if  the  ap-'  pointment  of  hi.  hr  ,ther  to  the  vacant  company  took  place  he  should  go  with  his  regiment  to  Goree.  Captain  Maling  did  join  a  detachment  of  the  African  corps:  who  were  doing  duty  al  , STYLE=superscript  oard  ,  a  prison  ship  ,,  but  was  subsequently  sent  to  Guernsey..  At  this  time  a  second  application  was  made  by  Major-General  Fraser  .  to  have  Captain  Maling  appointed  his  aid-de-camp.  The  an answer  swer answer  of  the  Commander  in  Chief  was,  that  he  approved  of.  Captain  Maling  being  employed  in  that  capacity  so  long,  as  a  detachment  of  his  corps  remained  in  that  island.  •  Q.  is  it  within  your  knowledge,  that  a  number  of  subalterns  who  had  served  longer  than  Capt.  Mating,  were  passed  by,  al although  though although  they  had  signified  their  wish  to  purchase?  A.  Unques Unquestionably  tionably Unquestionably  a  very  considerable  number.  It  is  the  invariable  prac-'  tice  in  the  army,  at  least  it  has  been  the  invariable  practice,:  since  the  period  when  his  Roytil  Highness  was  appointed  Com-  wander  in  Chief,  that  nojunior  officer  should  be  promoted  over'  the  head  of  a  senior  in  the  same  regiment.  This  regulation  did  not  extend  to  the  routine  of  the  whole  army.  It  is  my  duty  to  report,  that  the  officer  recommended  was  a  fit  and  proper  person  and  within  his  Majesty's  regulations.  That  Capt.  Maling  was  so  I  did  conceive,  and  I  know  him  to  lieu  promising  officer  as  any  in  the  army,  and  likely  to  do  honour  to  his  country.  Q.  Was  not  Colonel  Pigott,  of  the  14th  drag  oons,  promoted  over  a  senior  Major  in  that  regiment  ?  A.  hen  l  said  that,  such  an  occurrence  never  took  place,  I  did  mean  that  it  was  .  the  uniform  regulation  of  the  army  so  to  recowmend  O  ffi  cers,  unless  some  special  occasion  for  a  contrary  conduct,  took  place.  I.  believe  that  Colonel  Piggot  belonged  to  the  2lst  regiment,  and  I  am  certain  that  he  was  specifically  recommendedby  the'  Commanding  O  ffi  cer,  Lieut.-Gen.  Tiirleton.  Q.  Can  you  recollect  whether  at  the  period  of  f STYLE=superscript  CapeMalines;  promotionthere  were  any  number  of  recoMmendations  of  Kubal  terns  senior'to  him,  for  leave  to.'  *before  the  Dukeof  York  ?  great  number,  but  this  vacancy  was  not  filledup  by  purchase.  Q.  Without  purchase  ?  A.  It  is  very  rare  _that  these  wee.  The  applications  must  be  numerous  in  such  an  extensive  army:  Colonel  GORDON  then  said  that  there  were  no  regulations  in  the  army,  till  they  were  introduced  by  the  Duke  of  York.

Our  readers  cannot  but  remember,  that  the  reasons  assigned  for  acceding  to  the  Armistice  and  Convention  of  Ciutra,  consisted  in  the  almost  impreg impregnable  nable impregnable  strength  of  the  works  which  JUNOT  had  thrown  up  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Lisbon.  Have  these  works  been  demolished  ?  ur  have  they  vanished  into  air  ?  We  gave  no  .credit,  at  the  time  the  merits  of  the  Cintra  busi business  ness business  were  the  subject  of  discussion,  to  the  existence  of  these  fortified  positions;  and  we  founded  our  disbelief  on  the  probability  that  JUNOT  would  not  have  so  easily  consented  to  their  evacuation,  had  they  been  so  very  tenable  as  the  Conventionists,  their  friends,  and  dependants  had  repre represented  sented represented  them.

But  these  arc  pious  wishes  we  dare  not  indulge  in  ;  and  future  events,  we  arc  much  inclined  to  apprehend,  will  too  strongly  demonstrate  that  the  cries  of  indiguatioef  repeated  from  one  extremity  of  the  Empire  to  another,  were  not  only  just,  but  even  too  moderate,  considering  the  disgrace  N%  e  sustained,  and  the  pernicious  tendency  it  had  to  sow  discontent  among  the  Portuguese,  and  to  render  them  indifferent  to  the  liberation  of  their  country.  A  false  and  dangerous  opinion  begins  to  gain  ground,  fostered,  as  usual,  by  party  spirit,  and  re-echoed  by  hire hireling  ling hireling  writers,—that  Great  Britain  should  make  no  etiost  to  favour  of  the  Continent,  unless  the  natives  Isere  to  make  corresponding  exertions  and  sacrifices  in  support  of  their  independence.  To  lay  this  down  as  a  principle,  would  be  the  most  dangerous  maxim  we  could  adopt  in  pol  t  cal  reasoning,  or  in  practical  government.  Tee  moment  we  take  it  as  the  rule  of  our  conduct,  we  re renounce,  nounce, renounce,  for  ever,  every  hope  of  curtailing  the  present  alarming  preponderance  of  the  enemy,  and  abandon  every  wish  of  resisting  his  future  cucroachments.  thing  is  more  flattering  in  Pre  present  depraved  state  of  .

I  did  not  expect  to  be  ex examined  amined examined  as  to  any  other  subject  this  night.—Here  the  witness  was  permitted  to  withdraw.  Mr.  W.  ADAtit  thought  it  necessary  to  state  to  the  House,  that  so  far  back  as  the  year  17::9  he  had  been  honoured  with  a  com communication  munication communication  from  the  Duke  of  York  on  the  subject  of  his  pecan'.  are  concerns,  and  that  since  that  period  he  had  been  in  the  habit  of  directing  his  attention  to  his  Royal  Highness'  affairs.  It  came  to  his  knowledge  in  the  year  1805,  that  a  person,  calling  himself  tke  husband  of  Mrs.  Clarke,  had  brought  an  action  of  crint.  con.  against  the  illustrious  Duke.  This  circumstance  made  it  neces necessary  sary necessary  to  enquire  into  that  Lady's  affairs  ;  and  it  fell  to  his  lot  to  say  that  it  was  discovered  that  the  Lady's  conduct  had  not  been  so  correct  as  she  wished  to  represent  it.  Her  connection  with  his  Royal  Highness  it  was  apprehended  might  tend  to  injure  his  reputation,  not  in.  his  military  capacity  certainly,  but  with  re respect  spect respect  to  pecuniary  twitters,  by  her  extravagance  and  the  debts.  contracted.  At  this  period,  however,  the  Royal  Duke  was  not  inolined  to  believe  that  there  was  any  thing  wrong  in  the  conduct  of  this  Lady,  and  it  was  not  until  some  very  important  discoveries  were  made  that  his  !loyal  Highness  was  convinced  of  her  misbe misbehaviour.  haviour. misbehaviour.  She  had  repeatedly  endeavoured  to  extort  money  from  him,  and  these  attempts  could  be  brought  home  to  her  by  proof.  It  was  discovered,  that  in  1806,  Mr.  Clarke,  and  several  per person's,  son's, person's,  had  written  to  the  Duke  in  order  to  obtain  money.  Soon  stficr  he  had  an  interview  with  the  Lady,  his  Royal  Highness  baying  undertaken  to  defend  her  in  an  action,  in  which  she  had  described  herself  as  a  widow.  In  the  course  of  the  proceedings  it  appeared  that  she  was  a  married  woman.  Her  account  of  herself  was  very  contradictory;  on  one  occasion  she  sail  she  was  married  at  Pancras,  awl  on  another  at  Berkampstead,  where  her  father  was  a  farmer.  She  also  stated  that  her  husband  was  tile  nephew  of  Mr.  Alderman  Clarke.  His  Royal  Hir,liness  having  signified  his  wish  to  separate  from  this  lady,  he  (.Ir.  Adam)  was  asked  whether  he  had  any  objection  to  communi communicate  cate communicate  that  determination  to  her.  His  Royal  Highness  stated,  in  a  letter,  that  though  Mrs.  Clarke  had  not  in  any  respect  acted  correctly,  be  was  willing  to  give  her  an  annuity  of  4001.  a  year,  but  his  Royal  Ilighue.  , STYLE=superscript  3  tytainin4  the  power  to  withdraw  the  annuity  if  she  mi,conductea  herself.  Havoig  communicated  the  message  of  his  Royal  Highness,  he  left  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  bad  not  teen  her  from  that  time  to  the  present.  The  ATTORNEY  GESEHAL  then  put  several  questions  to  Colonel  Wardel  Q.  I  would  ask  the  Hon.  Member  whether  he  collected  what  he  stated  to  the  House  from  Mrs.  Clarke,  and  w  hether  he  has  stated  any  information  that  we  did  not  collect  from  her?  A.  1  bad  a  good  deal  of  information  from  her,  which  I  wrote  in  any  memorandum-book  ;  she  said  much  to  me.  Q.  Does  the  lion.  Member  know  whether  she  told  him  on  Thursday,  :he  25th  of  J  uly,  the  payment  of  the  200/.  was  made  ?  A.  From  her  a,•:iertions,  from  first  to  last,  no  doubt  remains  on  my  mind  that  she  did.  TheCUAN  zt.on  of  the  EXCLIZQVER  was  anxious  to  know  FEE';  5.  w  hat  courie  .the  Honourable  Member  who  brought  forward  this  question  intended  to  purNe.  Colonel  WARDLE  was  as  desirous  as  any  gentleman  could  be  that  the  business  might  be  proceeded  in  with  every  possible  dispatch.  It  would,  however,  be  necessary  for  him  to  wait  the  arrival  from  Spain  of  several  essential  witnesses,  among  orbefs  Captain  Huxley  Sande!),  and  hl:3jor-General  French.  Todeed  he  could  not  well  say  when  they  would  arrive,  as  no  return  having  been  made  of  the  killed  and  wounded,  it  was  impossible  to  say  whether  they  were  living.  After  some  pointed  diiimaeversions  from  Mr.  ADAM,  Mr.  WAR  nLE  assured  the  House  he  should  be  ready  to  bring  for forward  ward forward  Captain  Maling's  case  on  Friday.  It  was  then  ordered,  on  the  Motion  of  Mr.  Wit  A  !MIN,  that  the  minutes  of  evidence,  taken  that  night,  be  printed  and  laid  before  the  Hoase-  TIIVIttoDAY,  1:13.  2.  INCREASE  OF'  THE  ARMY.  Lord  CA  STLER  EA  Gil/  having  moved  the  second  reading  of  the  Militia  Enlistment  Bill,  said,  that  it  surely  was  not  necessary  for  him  to  enter  upon  a  detail  of  the  reasons  for  a  large  military  force  at  present.  The  executive  Government  ought  to  intim'  a  sufficient  force,  if  possible,  both  for  foreign  exertions  and  home  defence.  As  long  as  the  people  of  Spain  were  true  to  themselves,  we  were  bound  by  duty  and  interest  to  support  them.  He  could  nut  believe  the  struggle  to  be  at  an  end;  but  if  it  were  at  an  end.  something  might  grow  out  of  that  circumstance  which  might  atford  a  field  for  British  exertion.  Great  interests  might  be  at  stake  at  a  distance.  as  well  as  at  home.  and  it  was  proper  to  be  precared.  A  deduction  for  the  losses  in  Spain  must  be  made,  and  he  stated  that  a  very  considerable  proportion  of  the  battalions  of  the  army  (about  56)  were  below  six  hundred  rank  'mod  tile,  and  the  addition  by  this  measure  would  only  raise  these  to  900  rank  and  file.  In  the  army  that  went  to  Portugal,  the  first  battalions  had  been  filled  up  from  the  second,  which  rendered  it  a  very  efficient  army,  29,000  being  comprised  in  32  battalions;  and  this  measure  was  intended  to  fill  up  the  deficiency,  and  also  to  supply  the  casualties  in  Spain.  His  Lordship  then  observed,  that  even  while  the  country  were  labour labouring  ing labouring  under  these  measures,  and  under  the  burthens  of  unlimitled  service,  still  there  was  something  so  stubborn  in  the  nature  of  the  recruiting  service,  that  the  numbers  were  constantly  about  1,200  men  a  month  under  all  circumstances.  lie  contended,  that  it  was  necessary  to  allow  men  to  enter  for  unlimited  service  it  they  pleased,  as  this,  at  all  events,  would  leave  .a  permanent  feature  in  our  force.  lie  called  on  the  House  to  make  the  exer exertion  tion exertion  required,  as  it  was  their  first  ditty  to  their  country.  •It  was  impossible  that  at  present  there  could  be  any  danger  to  the  liberties  of  the  country,  not  only  by  the  checks  established,  bet  by  the  feeline,s  of  the  regular  army  itself,  which  felt  as  strong,ly  as  any  other  description  of  men  the  value  of  the  Constitution.  The  dangers  to  our  liberties  from  a  regular  army  were  past  e  or,  if  not,  the  checks  at  present  established  were  surely  sufficient.  Lord  TEst  eta:  said,  that  the  Noble  I.Grd  had  now  shewn  us  the  nature  and  spirit  of  the  measure,  for  the  transfer  was  not  now  made  on  an  emergency,  hut  in  contemplation  of  an  emer emergency.  gency. emergency.  So  that  this  was  now  to  become  a  regular  system  from  year  to  year.  This,  he  said,  was  a  very  bad  mode  of  increasing  the  regular  army,  and  as  a  regular  system,  he  had  the  strongest  objection  to  it.  His  Lordship  also  defended  the  plan  of  his  Right  Hon.  Friend  (Mr.  Windham),  and  stated,  that  when  the  Noble  Lord  laid  his  cold  fingers  upon  it,  it  was  producing  at  the  rate  of  24,000  a  year,  instead  of  the  13,000  produced  by  the  Noble  Lord  ;  and  out  of  the  27,000  that  volunteered  from  the  Militia,  20,000  were  for  limited  service  at  a  loWer  bounty.

There  was  no  doubt  that  money  had  been  given,  but  the  question  was,  whether  lois  Royal  Highness  knew  of  that  circumstance,  and  had  been  smiled  upon  by  her  influence  to  grant  promotions  and  exchanges  in  the  army.
