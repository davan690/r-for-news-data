The  Charges  against  the  Commander  in  Chief  appeared,  for  some  time,  to  have  excluded  every  other  subject  from  the  public  attention.  Serious  as  these  charges  are;  repulsive  and  afflicting  as  it  must  be  to  every  honest  man  to  see  a  personage  so  nearly  allied  to  the  throne,  and  filling  the  highest  ostensible  situation,  convicted  of  an  association  with  a  vile  woman,  and  accused  of  participating  in  her  ini iniquity,  quity, iniquity,  we  do  not  consider  them,  however,  of  that  exclusive  consequence,  as  to  sacrifice  to  them  every  other  object  of  national  inquiry  and  alarm,  It  may  be  the  interest  of  fac factious,  tious, factious,  or  ►mercenary,  journalists  to  rivet  the  popular  feel feeling  ing feeling  on  a  subject  so  gratifying  to  party-rancour,  and  fa favourable  vourable favourable  to  the  financial  speculations  of  newspaper-pro newspaper-proprietors  prietors newspaper-proprietors  ;  but  we  would  blush  for  ourselves  and  ourcountry  if  we  were  conscious  that  [the  intrigues  of  a  prostitute,  the  weakness  of  her  paramour,  and  the  vices  of  her  despicable  associates,  were  capable  of  diverting  the  vigilance  and  *anxiety  of  the  public  from  the  progress  and  developement  of  that  monstrous  power,  which  has  so  successfully  con conspired  spired conspired  against  the  happiness  and  freedom  of  our  neighbours.

While  such  a  man  is  annexing  every  month  a  new  kingdom,  or  province,  to  the  immense  empire  he  has  created,  whilst  his  followers  enjoy,  in  triumphant  anticipation,  the  plunder  of  the  British  islands,  to  turn  incessantly  the  regards  of  our  readers  on  the  petty  squabbles  and  the  groveling  vices  of  the  wretches  implicated  by  the  late  investigation,  would  betray  equal  inditlerence  to  the  honour  and  safety  of  thecoantry.

These,.considerations  arc  sufficiently  impressive  to  in inspire  spire inspire  with  firmness  and  patriotism  a  less  independent  and  less  virtuous  House  of  Commons  than  the  present.  Their  proceedings  must  determine  whether  the  moral  resources  of  this  country  are  sufficient  to  resist  the  tempest,  which,  •  with  the  most  frightful  symptoms,  is  gathering  round  it.  The  highest  stretch  of  human  virtue,  wisdom  and  energy  is  alone  competent  to  preserve  us  from  the  calamities  which  have  befallen  our  neighbours  ;  and,  we  cannot  conceal  it,  the  Moment  is  fast  approaching,  when  we  must  undergo  this  severe  and  unparallelled  trial.  A  tremendous  crisis  is  near  at  hand  ;  and  impressed  with  the  awful  conviction,  we  turn  away,  with  horror  and  disgust,  from  a  Mrs.  Clarke,  her  associates  and  paramour,  and  consigning  them  to  the  punishment,  or  contempt,  which  the  law,  or  public  opinion,  may  inflict,  will  propose  some  measures  in  order  to  meet  with  fortitude  the  alarming  occurrences.  Our  own  nature  is  too  mercurial  to  give  way  to  despondency  ;  and  at  exig exigence  ence exigence  we  would  spurn,  were  it  dependent  on  the  brutal  caprice  of  a  tyrant.

The  fifth  act  of  the  dreadful  tragedy,  which,  for  more  than  nineteen  years,  excited  the  sympathy  and  terror  of  mankind,  is  upon  the  point  of  commencing.  The  maths  has  already  been  raised  a  little,  and  the  appearance  of  the  hero  of  the  piece  is  looked  for  with  anxious,  trembling  impatience.  It  bears  a  striking  resemblance  to  the  pro productions  ductions productions  of  our  immortal  bard.

Whether  he  succeeds,  entirely  de depends  pends depends  on  the  rapidity  with  which  the  former  anticipates  the  attack.  As  the  present  force  he  has  in  Germany  and  in  Italy  is  perfectly  incompetent  to  the  attainment  of  his  object,  he  will,  probably,  attempt  to  lull  Austria,  by  a  semblauce  of  negociation,  into  security,  until  the  necessary  reinforcements  arrive  from  Spain.  But  this  dis  Simulation,  we  would  reasonably  suppose,  could  not  impose  on  the  most  limited  and  artless  peasant  on  the  Croatian  Moun Mountains,  tains, Mountains,  much  less  on  a  Cabinet  which  has  experienced  so  many  proofs  of  the  insincerity  and  treachery  of  the  tyrant.  It  is  impossible,  however,  to  determine  how  far  the  credu credulity  lity credulity  and  infatuation  of  Cabinets  may  not  extend.  But  of  the  departure  of  the  greater  part  of  the  French  force  now  in  Spain,  with  the  obvious  intention  of  giving  the  last  blow  tri  German  independence,  we  do  not  entertain  the  remotest  doubt.  In  this  the  tyrant  acts  consistently,  and  according  to  the  principles  of  the  justest  political  calculation.  That  he  has  been  evidently  disappointed  as  to  the  facility  with  which  he  expected  to  bend  the  Spaniards  to  the  yoke,  is  notorious  from  his  own.  declarations  some  months  ago,  when  be  said  that  even  was  to  be  accomplished  before  the  Ist  of  January.  Another  gross  deception  he  fell  into  was,  the  indifference  he  supposed  the  great  body  of  that  people  would  feel  to  the  atrocious  means  he  employed  to  compass  that  end.  He  has  now  learned,  by  personal  observation,  that  all  his  triamphs  and  dearly-purchased  victories  in  that  Country,  have  not  brought  him  a  step  nearer  to  the  ac accomplishment  complishment accomplishment  of  his  purpose,  than  he  had  been  ih  Attgust  last.  lie  has  broke  and  dissipated  their  armies  ;  but  ;  in  proportion  to  their  reverses,  their  abhorrence  of  him  and  his  detested  family,  has  acquired  additional  force  in  the  breasts  attic  na  ti  yes.  His  promises,  his  threats,  his  cajolings,  his  menaced  vengeance,  and  profound  dissinmlation  f  have  not  gained  a  single  partisan  among  the  middling  and  lower  classes;  and  he  has  sustained  the  corroding  mortification  ;  that  all  his  artifice,  and  seduction,  and  promised  reform,  the  not  produce  even  a  particle  of  confidence,  or  abate  the  deep  rooted,  national  antipathy  to  himself  and  parti partisans.  sans. partisans.

Besides,  a  much  less  profound  politician  than  BONA BONAPA  PA BONAPA  RTE  unquestionably  is,  would  have  discovered,  from  some  symptoms  in  the  North  of  Europe,  that  the  Empe Emperor  ror Emperor  ALEXANDER  begins  to  display  coolness,  if  not  signs  of  decided  hostility;  and  that  a  great  alteration  has  taken  place  in  the  views  and  sentiments  of  that  Cabinet,  he  might  have  surmised,  from  the  continuation  of  the  armistice  in  Finland.  The  journey  of  theKlisto  and  QUEEN  of  PRUSSIA  to  St.  Petersburgh,  contrary  to  his  unquestionable  inclina inclination,  tion, inclination,  and  in  manifest  contempt  of  the  permission  he  grant granted  ed granted  them  to  return  to  their  capital,  has  changed  surmise  into  certainty.  This  determination  of  FREDF.RICK  WIL WILLIAM  LIAM WILLIAM  has  disappointed  him  besides  of  another  royal  prey  ;  for  had  they  been  guilty  of  the  unsuspecting  generosity  to  return  to  their  former  capital,  whilst  Stettin,  Dantzic,  and  other  fortresses  were  garrisoned  by  the  French,  they  would  mow,  according  to  human  probability,  share  the  fate  of  the  Royal  Family  of  Spain.

The  precipitate  return  of  BON  APA  RTE  to  Paris,  and  the  short  sojourn  he  is  said  to  have  made  there,  seem  to  confirm  that  the  revolution  io  this  elrect  is  even  greater  than  Ise  have  the  courage  to  hope.

By  this  measure  the  Kier;  of  PRUSSIA  threw  the  gauntlet  in  the  tyrant's  face,  and  destroyed  every  possibility  of  future  reconciliation  or  pardon.  A  circumstance,  not  sufficiently  adverted  to,  though  mention mentioned  ed mentioned  in  the  German  and  Dutch  papers,  will  shew,  in  the  clearest  light,  the  sentiments  of  the  most  distinguished  persons  in  Prussia,  on  the  present  vacillating  state  of  con continental  tinental continental  politics,  and  fully  corroborate  our  own  conjec conjectures.  tures. conjectures.

Such  is  the  present  situation  of  that  part  of  the  Continent  ;  which  is  not  under  the  immediate  and  absolute  controul  of  the  enemy.  Another  change,  not  less  auspicious,  has  taken  place  iu  Turkey  ;  and  the  Divan  has  already  con concluded  cluded concluded  a  peace  with  our  Government.  It  was  necessary  to  take  this  view,  in  order  to  estimate  the  chances  which  Austria  has,  in  case  of  a  rupture  with  France.  We  have  given,  in  a  former  Number,  some  details  relative  to  her  present  military  force.  We  have,  in  the  same  Number,  adverted  to  the  propriety  of  acting  now,  in  preference  to  any  future  occasion  ;  and  our  reasons  will  s  we  believe,  have  convioced  the  most  obstinate,  silly,  or  knavish  oppo opponent  nent opponent  of  Continental  resistance.  Procrastination,  the  mania  of  negociatinn  - STYLE=superscript  ,  a  concealment  from  her  subjects  of  her  whole  mass  of  grievances,  and  the  folly  of  relying  on  the  arts  of  diplomacy,  instead  of  the  sword,  are  the  principal  dangers  we  apprehend  for  that  Power  in  the  present  crisis.

0012,"ARMY  ESTI7IIATES.  The  St.cnr.T  tRV  at  WAR  called  the  attention  of  the  Com Committee  mittee Committee  to  the  remaining  Army  Estimates,  and  stated,  that  though  he  did  not  think  it  necessary  to  recapitulate  the  sums  formerly  voted  under  this  head,  he  should  be  happy,  however.  to  stnswer  any  question  respecting  them,  or  the  farther  items  he  was  nosy  about  to  submit  to  their  appmhation.  lie  would  only  remark,  with  respect  to  the  sums  formerly  voted,  that  an  increase  would  he  noticed  of  7  or  S  thousand  pounds  more  than  the  estimate  of  last  year,  for  the  pay  of  the  army.  This  increase  was  to  be  ac accounted  counted accounted  for,  from  an  additional  increase  ofthe  army,  the  regular  army  being  greater  at  present  than  it  was  last  3  ear,  and  the  Militia  more  considerable  by  not  less  than  12  or  18,000  men.—  With  regard  to  the  remaining  sums  to  be  voted,  there  were  a  few  points  of  variation  also  from  last  year.  The  estimate  for  the  Staff  or  Garrisons  would  be  necessarily  more  considerable  than  last  year.  The  sum  voted  for  this  purpose  last  year  had  come  much  short  of  the  expenditure,  on  account  of  the  foreign  service,  not  foreseen  at  the  time  of  voting  those  estimates.  In  the  allowance  for  the  Chelsea  pensioners,  there  was  a  consider considerable  able considerable  increase,  from  the  increase  of  the  persons  in  want  of  that  relief,  and  to  tbe  sum  for  widows'  pensions  there  was  also  a  small  addition,  arising  from  the  same  cause.  In  the  estimate  for  the  several  volunteer  corps,  there  was  a  decrease  of  300,0(101.  owing  to  the  considerable  decrease  that  had  taken  place  in  that  descrip.  tint;  of  force;  but  the  Local  Militia  being  a  new  and  more  ex expensive  pensive expensive  establishment  than  the  volunteers,  an  increase  of  1,200,0001.  had  heen  occasioned  on  that  account.  This  increase,  however,  to  the  whole  of  the  amount  would  not  be  an  annual  expense,  as  their  clothing,  amounting  to  400,0001.  would  last  for  four  years.  The  following  sums  were  then  voted  :  For  defraying  the  charge  of  Officers  4ef  the  Public  De-  .  partmem  .  •  L.  257,711  For  the  In  and  OM  Penbioners  of  Chelsea  and  Kil Kilmainham  mainham Kilmainham  Hospitals  492,412  For  Pensions  to  'Widows  of  Officers  49,437  Volunteer  Corps  for  Great  Britain  and  Ireland  1,000,5,0  Local  `lllitial,Xl9,Bo3  Mr.  BRAND  wished  to  know  how  the  expences  attending  the  Volunteers  were  not  diminished  from  those  of  last  year,  in  the  same  proportion  as  their  numbers  had  been  diminished  by  their  transfer  into  the  Local  Militia.  Mr.  HussitssoN  observed  in  reply,  that  this  was  in  a  great  measure  owing  to  the  circumstance,  that  the  Volunteer  Cavalry,  the  most  expensive  part  of  the  Establishment,  were  still  ke.  up;  and  that  this  year  the  expeoce  of  cloathing  the  Volum  would  be  incurred.

It  certainly  svhS,  In  his  opinion  very  desirable  that  the  present  systro,  of  bankrupt  law's'  should  be  abolished  altogether,  and  another  substituted  in  its  place.

This  was  evidently  a  great  abuse,  and  he  meant  to  pro propose,  pose, propose,  that  the  creditors  should  be  authorised  to  appoint  a  bank,  in  which  the  bankrupt's  property  may  be  deposited.  The  creditors  had  this  power  already,  but  there  was  no  penalty  on  the  assignees  for  non-compliance.  By  way  of  remedy  he  meant  to  propose,  that  if  the  creditors  did  not  at  their  second  meeting  appoint  such  a  place  of  deposit,  then  it  :hi)  ;id  he  done  ;my  the  commissioners;  and  that  the  assignees  should  be  charged  20  per  cent.  on  the  value  of  all  time  efiects  which  they  kept  in  their  hands.  lie  also  meant  to  pro propose  pose propose  enactments  which  ••could  have  the  effect  of  lessening  the  expellees  attending  commissions  of  bankruptcy  :  in  particular,  that  no  actions  at  law  should  be  brought  against  assignees  fur  non-payment  of  dividends,  which  was  a  very  fruitful  source  of  ex expencobto  pencobto expencobto  the  bankrupt's  estate.  He  proposed  that  in  such  cases  there  should  be  a  summary  remedy  by  petition  to  the  Lord  Chancellor.  An  uncertificated  bankrupt  was  placed  in  the  most  deplorable  situation.  His  industry  was  lug  to  himself,  and  to  the  country,  because  he  could  never  con  s  ider  the  fr  u  it  s  of  it  as  his  own,  and  he  was  constantly  liable  to  be  impri imprisoned  soned imprisoned  during  the  remainder  of  his  life,  for  debts  contracted  previous  to  his  bankruptcy.  Before  the  Act  of  the  30m  Geo.  11.  the  granting  of  a  certificate  was  left  to  the  Chan,  cellar  alone;  but  now  by  that  Act  it  was  left  to  the  creditors,  and  unless  four-fifths  of  them  in  number  and  value  consented  to  his  'Teel  vinga  certificate,  however  fair  and  honourable  the  con conduct  duct conduct  of  the  bankrupt  had  been  she  was  liable  to  remain  'facer  tificated  for  li  fe.  This  was  not  the  only  hardship  ;  for  he  knew  if  to  be  the  fact,  from  his  experience  in  the  Court  of  Chancery,  that  creditors  sometimes  kept  away,  the  bankrupt  did  not  receive  his  certificate,  and  he  immediately  became  liable  to  imprison imprisonment  ment imprisonment  by  the  creditor  who  kept  aloof.  This  part  of  the  subject  was  connected  with  the  policy  of  imprisonment  for  life  on  ac account  count account  of  debt,  and  on  it  he  would  express  his  opinion,  that  it  would  be  doing  the  greatest  benefit  to  society  by  abolishing  altogether  such  a  system.  If  the  bankrupt  retained  any  property,  his  life  was  forfeited  ;  and  after  all  he  was  liable  to  be  imprisoned  for  not  having  what  he  thus  could  not  possibly  have.  From  his  experience  he  could  say,  certificates  were  seldom  withheld  from  dishonest  bankrupts,  hut  often  from  those  who  had  acted  honestly.  The  general  object  of  withholding  these  certificates  was  to  ex extort  tort extort  money,  either  from  the  bankrupts  themselves,  at  after  periods,  or  from  their  relatives,  and  the  father  of  the  bankrupt,  from  paternal  sympathy,  was  ()Reim  compelled  to  part  with  the  earnings  of  a  life  of  iutiost  ry  to  save  his  on  from  perpetual  im imprisonment.  prisonment. imprisonment.  The  number  of  uncertifieateil  bankrupts  aas  very  great.  In  the  year  ISO)  there  were  940  ban!crupts,  and  of  these  there  werelSl  without  a  certificate  ;  iu  1;406  there  were  WS  and  of  these  601  were  uneertificated.  Within  the  1:14  20  years,  the  whole  number  of  bankrupts  had  been  16,202.  and  of  these  0,597  were  without  certificates.  In  1772,  a  temnoorary  Act  was  passed,  similar  to  the  Insolvency  Act,  by  which  time  Lord  Chancellor  was  empowered  to  grant  certificates  in  such  bank bankrupts  rupts bankrupts  as  he  thought  proper  ;  and  in  1775,  a  similar  Act  was  passed.  Was  it  reasonable  that  the  fate  of  bankrupts  should  be  more  in  the  power  of  their  credttors  now  th;al  was  thought  proper  then  I  Why  should  these  acts  have  been  only  temporary  What  he  should  propose  was  this  :  ifat  the  end  of  2  years  after  the  bank bankrupt's  rupt's bankrupt's  last  examination  his  certificate  should  not  he  signed  by  four-fifths  of  his  creditors,  then  he  might  apply  for  it  to  the  Lord  Chancellor,  who  should  have  power  to  grant  the  same,  unless  the  creditors  assigned  satisfactory  grounds  for  the  refusal.  He  should  propose  also  that  this  should  have  a  retrospective  in influence,  fluence, influence,  and  that  all  those  who  were  at  present  w  ithout  their  cer certificates  tificates certificates  for  two  years  should  have  liberty  to  appeal  to  the  Lord  Chancellor.  Here  it  might  be  asked,  had  he  nothing  to  propose  for  securing  the  punishment  of  dishonest  bankrupts,  the  numbers  of  whom  had  multiplied.

The  third  mon  on  the  estimates  was  200,000'.  for  depots  of  artillery  - STYLE=superscript  and  ammunition.  These  three  sums  amounted  to  rather  more  than  a  million,  which  was  about  20.000/.  less  than  the  same  articles  amounted  last  year.

General  TARRT.Eros  rise  to  put  several  questions  relative  to  the  military  affairs  of  the  country.  Sir  A.  W  ELLESLEY  spoke  at  some  length  in  reply  to  the  Hon Honourable  ourable Honourable  Gene's:J.  to  discussine  the  campaign  in  Portugal,  the  Ilonctira!  , STYLE=superscript  le  General  seemed  to  throw  upon  him  the  responsibi responsibility  lity responsibility  eo.f  the  Convention  of  Clara,  and  to  assert  that  that  measure  might  have  peen  preTented  by  his  ititerference.  Now  though  he  (Sir  A.  Wellesley)  did  flatter  himself  that  he  ettioed  in  some  degree  the  confidence  of  the  army,  and  had  been  favoured  with  confidential  intercourse  from  Ministers,  yet  he  soon  perceived  that  he  did  not  possess  the  confidence  of  those  superior  officers  who  were  appointed  his  successors.  He  drew  this  conclusion  from  having  proposed  two  distinct  measures  to  Sir  Harry  Bur Burrard,  rard, Burrard,  both  of  which  were  rejected  ;  and  from  the  very  first  con conversation  versation conversation  which  he  had  with  Sir  Hew  Dalrymple,  he  had  rea rea.aen  .aen rea.aen  to  suppose  that  he  did  not  possess  the  confidence  of  that  officer.  He  had  uniformly  stated,  however,  that  he  approved  of  the  principle  of  that  Convention,  though  he  thought  that  the  tore  :  of  some  of  the  articles  was  too  low  for  a  conquering  army  tqficree  to.  But  feeling  that  he  did  not  enjos  the  con  fidence  obis  superior  officer,  lie  thought  that  it  would  not  have  been  becoming  his  character,  either  as  an  officer  or  a  gentleman,  to  have  s.tt  up  his  standard  in  defiance  of  the  Commander  in  Chief.  As  to  the  campaign  in  Spain,  it  did  not  appear  to  him  that  Mi Ministers  nisters Ministers  were  at  all  responsible  for  the  line  of  retreat  adopted  by  Sir  J.  Moore.  General  TARLETON  spoke  in  explanation.  The  Right  Hon.  Gentleman  had  said,  that  he  expected  considerable  aid  from  the  Portuguese  cavalry,  us  reason  why  he  had  not  brought  from  this  country  a  greater  cavalry  force.  Now  he,  (General  'fade 'fadetoo)  too) 'fadetoo)  from  •his  own  experience,  could  have  told  him,  that  the  Portuguese  cavalry  were  the  most  ridiculous  force  imaginable.  A  Captain,  on  ireing  promoted  to  a  Company,  told  him  once  that  it  was  a  stiod  thing,  as.be  would  make  5001.  a  year  of  it  ;  but  th;  irsayaft  horses  were  employed  in  drawing  all  the  hack-  Voaches  iu  Lisbon.  Mr.  HUIRISSON  mid,  that  the  Vote  of  Credit,  and  the  dis•  posal  of  .the  sums  so  voted,  would,  in  due  time,  be  laid  before  the  'Louse,  wyen  Gentlemen  would  have  an  opportunity  of  en entering  tering entering  into  the  merits  of  the  question,  and  when  his  31ajehty's  Ministers,  he  was  certain,  wttuld  not  shrink  from  the  discussion.

It  is  a  blue  Rudy  from  a  disfigured  cast  or  model.  The  young  wounded  officer  has  a  ghastly,  toeneaning  countenance  ;  and  as  his  eves  are  directed  towards  the  spectator,  he  disturbs  the  harmony  of  the,  whole  piece.

The  Morning  Chronicle  has  been  betrayed  likewise  into  error  by  this  very  article  from  Lintz  ;  and  appears  to  credit  its  statements.  It  is  usual  with  the  French  Government,  whenever  it  wishes  to  delude  the  public  opinion  in  France,  or  the  neigh neighbouring  bouring neighbouring  states,  to  fabricate  articles,  which  are  ushered  to  the  world  as  pretended  extracts  from  foreign  journals,  These  generally  appear  in  some  one  of  the  minor  Paris  papers,  and  are  afterwards  copied,  in  all  the  journals  in  Germany,  llollaud,  and  France,  and  other  countries  under  the  con controut  trout controut  of  the  tyrant.  The  remarks  on  Turkey  generally  appeared  under  the  title  of  Notices  from  Presburg.  Those  relative  to  Spain,  and  which  were  calculated  to  prove  the  facility  and  advantage  of  subjugating  that  country,  made,  perhaps,  their  first  appearance  in  the  Hamburgh  Correspon Correspondenten,  denten, Correspondenten,  or  the  Franckfort  Journal  ;  and  from  thence  found  their  way  into  the  Paris  and  other  papers.

After  having  formed  the  project  of  subverting  the  Austrian  Monarchy,  it  is  his  interest  to  circulate  the  report  that  its  military  resources  are  extremely  incomplete,  and,  consequently,  the  execution  is  by  no  means  difficult.  Upon  the  same  principle,  if  such  a  man,  as  the  ARCHDUKE  CHARLES,  who,  by  the  bye,  enjoys,  among  the  French  officers,  the  highest  repu,  tation  for  military  talents,  is  supposed  to  disapprove  the  measures  of  his  Court,  the  inference  is  naturally  made,  that  the  situation  of  Austria  must  be  desperate,  anil  her.subju her.subju'  ' her.subju'  gation  inevitable,  T  1  P9_TB00016 I  THE  NATIONAL  REGISTER.

Mr.  Faulkener,  wa,  Minister  of  Ely-Chapel,  and  Afternoon  Lecturer  at  St.  (iiles's  in  the  Fields  :  41r.  Wilcox  is  also  Minister  of  Ely-Chapel,  and  Lecturer  ot  St.  Cieorge  the  Martyr  ia  Southwark.  Mr.  I'aulkencr  was  numer numerously  ously numerously  followed,  and  is  still  held  41  remembrance,  by  the  chart:hrs.  IVilcox  is  now  highly  esteemed;  and  is  likely  to  gain,  as  well  as  continue,  in  general  estimation  as  a  chnstian  preacher.  Let  me  be  indulged  to  pause,  for  some  short  moments,  on  the  clerical  character  of  Mr.  Faulkener;  who  is  thus  recalled  to  my  observation,  and  of  whom  I  scent  to  retain  theanost  lively  recol recollection.  lection. recollection.  Elisha  Faulkener  lived  but  for  the  pulpit.  His  professional  feeling  was  in  him  paramount  to  all  other  feelings  ;  and,  what  is  not  always  the  case,  his  ability  WaS  not  inferior  to  his  inclina inclination.  tion. inclination.  His  sermons,  which,  two  or  three  head-ootes  excepted,  were  generally  extemporaiwOus,  were  intrinsically  interesting,  and  were  always  delivered  with  an  euergy  and  dignity  truly  im impressive.  pressive. impressive.  No  preacher  bett:l  - STYLE=superscript  knew  the  authority  attached  to  t',e  sacerdotal  cuaracter,  or  more  eilicaciously  availed  him:elf  of  its  commanding.  influence.  Ins  ardour  invested  hint  with  that  dignity  to  w  bleb  his  person  was  not  fully  intaled.  11  is  looks,  his  speech,  his  action,  all  bespoke  him  conscious  of  his  sub sublime  lime sublime  function.  It  VI  71S  iMpOSsi  hie  tint  to  listen  to  hint,  and  equally  impossible  to  hear  him  indifferently.  lie  affected  others  as  himself  appeared  to  he  affected.  llis  was  the  eloquence  of  the  heart,  rather  than  of  the  tongue  ;  for  his  language  was  sim simple,  ple, simple,  his  illustrations  todaboured  b  and  his  sentenee,softeo  neAligent neAligently  ly neAligently  constructed.  lle  spoke,  however,  as  one  having  authurn,  and  not  as  the  scribes.  His  error  consisted  in  carrying  this  superi superiority  ority superiority  to  an  extent  that  sometimes  bordered  on  pomposity.  It  %Vas  indeed  amazing  ;  short  as  he  was  in  stature,  to  contemplate  him  walking  down  the  aisle  of  the  church,  aud  then  ascetalmg  the  pulpit.  The  pulpit  was  his  throne  upon  earth  ;  though  it  formed  only  the  steps  of  that  throne,  to  w  hich,  let  us  believe,  he  has  now  ascende  tin  heaven!  Ile  must  be  considered  as  one  of  the  last  of  the  old-school  of  preachers  iu  this  couotrv.  lie  is,  therefore,  to  be  classed  with  the  Madans,  and  Patiicks,  and  Colons,  and  Decoetlogons,  of  I  he  pul  .  1  feel  pleasure  in  saying,  el.en  while  now  entering  upon  this  clerical  criticism,  that  the  V.  J  %%  LCO  promises  to  supply  one  of  the  malty  vacancies  which  the  decease  of  vari various  ous various  eminent  clerg)  men,  together  with  the  augmenting  intirioi intirioities  ties intirioities  of  others,  have  occasioned  in  the  christian  church.  Hal,  log  generally  premised  this  opinion  of  his  preaching,  I  shall,  front  anxiety  for  his  improving  and  maturing  those  ministerial  qualifi qualifications  cations qualifications  v.  ith  which  he  is  happily  ;..,.ifted,  candidly  state  the  par particulars  ticulars particulars  in  which  he  strikes  the  as  being  still  defective.  The  person  of  the  present  Preacher  gives  him  many  advantages  ns  an  orator.  IL  is  rather  tall  ;  his  form  is  manly,  deport deportment  ment deportment  dignified,  and  his  countenance  prepossessing.  Is  he  nut  too  seen-ible  of  these  personal  qualifications  ?  I  would  not  he  severe  concerning  Mr.  Wilcox;  but  I  could  not  amid  ste:pccting,  oiwe  or  t  w  ice  during  his  Sermon  for  the  Benefit  of  the  I.uodon  Female  Yetiitentiary,  that,  conscious  of  his  pulpit  powers,  he  rather  cit.:minded  admiration.  Ido  not  mean  to  question  1113  sincerity,  of  which  his  unfeigned  earnestness  was  the  best  evidence.  Certainly,  however,  there  seemed  too  touch  of  uratorieal  preparation  about  his  professional  deportment  ;  and  too  much  anticipation  of  the  success  of  his  preaching.  Let  him,  if  possible,  discard  the  precision  of  taking  off  his  spectacles,  after  he  enters  the  pulpit,  and  at  the  exact.  instant  when,  having  closed  this  portion  of  devotional  melody,  he  is  proceeding  to  pray,  befora  sermon,  for  himself  and  his  'hearers.  lie  makes  little  use  of  his  glasses  afterwards;  aunt  he  might,  at  any  rite,  defer  putting  totem  On  till  he  was  about  to  read  and  announce  his  text.
