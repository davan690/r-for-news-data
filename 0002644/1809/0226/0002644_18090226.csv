0001,"'  POLITICAL  DISQUISITION.  NUMBER  FIFTY-NINE.  EUA.RGES  AGAINST  TUE  DUKI  OF  YORK.  The  investigation  of  the  Committee  closed  on  Wednesday  last  ;  and  whatever  pain  or  repugnance  we  feel,  we  arc  forced,  in  compliance  willi  the  indignant  and  outraged  feelings  of  the  public,  and  our  own  sense  of  their  momentous  consequence,  to  resume  the  subject  of.  these  charges.  They  have  brought  to  light  a  mbltiaide  of  &amp;grant  abuses,  and  detectisd  a  villainous  system  of  peculation,  which  no  'nail,  who  was  anxious  either  for  the  honour  or  the  safety  of  his  country,  would  credit,  though  their  existence  was  repeatedly  alluded  to.  We  will  not  accuse  his  Royal  Highness  of  countenancing,  or  conniving  at,  the  malversations  arrverted  to  during  the  course  of  the  Inquiry  ;  and,  in  conformity  with  the  humane  and  enlightened  spirit  of  our  laws,  will  scrupulously  refrain  from  prejudging  his  conduct.  There  are  crimes  which  an  honest  man  feels  a  horror  in  attri attributing  buting attributing  to  others,  particularly  to  t  h  ose  whose  station  and  rank  preclude,  as  he  would  willingly  suppose,  the  possibil:tv  of  a  mean  or  iniquitous  action;  and  his  struggling  faith,  with  con convulsive  vulsive convulsive  grasp,  clings  fast  to  the  idea  of  human  excellency,  till  repeated  +-hocks  w  rest  from  liiin  this  fascinating  support.  These  motives  of  repugnance  to  believe  in  the  official  delin delinquency  quency delinquency  of  the  Commander  in  Chief  are  confirmed  by  the  consi consideration  deration consideration  how  much  it  is  his  interest  not  to  undermine,  by  an  encou encouragement  ragement encouragement  of  abuses,  the  veneration  and  attachment  of  the  public  for  an  establishment,  which  secures  to  him,  as  Prince  of  the  Blond,  a  number  of  advantages  and  privileges  over  the  rest  of  his  fellow:-  citizens.  If  his  understanding  be  on  a  level  with  that  of  the  bilk  of  mankind;  if  he  he  in  the  habit  of  forming  the  simplest  combi combination  nation combination  of  ideas,  or  povsess  the  pimer  of  discriminating  between  momentary  and.  permanent,  artificial  and  solid  advantage,  his  every  thought,  word,  and  action,  would  invariably  tend  to  maintain,  in  their  highest  purity.  institutions  so  favourable  to  him  individually.  To  suspect  him  of  contrary  pretensions,  or  to  accuse  him  of  being  dissatisfied  with  the  rank,  fortune,  and  influence  he  so  pre-eminently  enjoys  in  society,  and  of  a  desire  to  augment,  by  illicit  means,  the  advantages  he  already  possesses,  :tiouttl  imply  a  deficiency,  on  his  part,  of  common  feeling  and  common  understanding.  Will  any  man,  therefore,  have  the  courage  to  condemn  us  if  we  still  entertain  hopes  that  the  Com Commander  mander Commander  in.  Chief  might  haye  been  ignorant  of  the  infamous  traffic  which  some  vile  miscreants  carried  .  on  under  the  cover  of  his  W  name.  e  may  be  accused  of  weakness,  of  want  pf  courage  and  patriotikm  ;  but  we  must  confess  we  would  feela  .horror  in  believinglhim  •  capable  of  associating  with  a  Mrs.  Clcke,  s  a  anda.:  Captain  Sandon,  fpr  the,igripininious  purpos  e  of  converting  the  patronage  of  the  Army  into  the  means  of  gratify gratifying  ing gratifying  his  private  vices,  and  the  extravagant  _wants  of  his  mistress.

The  Commons,  we  trust,  will  not  forget  their  otvn  dignity,  the  responsibility  of  their  situation,  and  the  ditties  they  owe  their  constituents.

Their  conduct,  at  the  commencement  of  the  inquiry  gives  every  reason  to  conclude  that  they  will  remain  consequent  to  the  last;  and  as  they  expressed  so  much  satisfaction  at  the  motion  of  Mr.  WA  ROLE,  as  their  triumph  was  so  loud  that  theseaccusations  were  brought  forward  in  a  tangible  shape,  they  w  ill  convince  the  country  of  the  sincerity  of  their  effusions,  byre byrecommending  commending byrecommending  the  only  issue  which  is  left  the  accwed  to  use  the  benefit  and  as  his  Royal  Highness  demands,  of  those  sanctions,  under  which  alone  evidence  is  received  in  the  ordinary  administration  of  the  NVe  have  considered  the  subject  as  yet  as  only  relating  to  the  Commander  in  Chiefof  the  Army,  without  the  slightest  referetice  to  him  as  Prince  of  the  Blood.  Should  we  iak  •up  the  matter  in  this  light,  it  becomes  more  serious  and  important.  The  whole  transaction  immediately  assumes  a  greater  degree  of  interest  ;  and  what  we  may  be  inclined  to  palliate  in  the  former,  we  dare  not  excuse  in  the  latter  character.  It  then  becomes  a  subject  of  inquiry  whether  a  member  of  the  Royal  Family  is  amenable  to  the  same  laws  as  every  other  individual  in  the  country?  Whe Whether  ther Whether  he  has,  in  that  capacity,  any  distinct  privileges  which  secure  him  from  responsibility,  or  insure  him  iinpuniti  in  ease  of  delinquency  ?  We  believe  the  Constitution  admits  of  to  such  distinction;  but  supposes  every  man  who  tills  an  eflicial  situation,  as  responsible  for  the  manner  in  which  he  discharges  it.  It  is  from  an  apprehension  that  any  plea  of  this  kind.  might  he  set  up,  that  an  appearance  of  acri acrimony  mony acrimony  and  bias  mixed  itself  in  the  judgments  of  the  Public.  —  They  began,  from  the  very  beginning,  to  cnnsider  it  as  an  issue  aright  between  a  number  of  the  Royal  Family  and  the  people  of  Great  Britain,  and,  for  fear  of  a  dangerous  and  unconstituti unconstitutional  onal unconstitutional  precedent,  anxiously  insisted  on  the  urgency  of  a  strict  and  legal  investigation.  There  was  no  bias,  no  partiality  divlayed  against  the  individual  ;  but  all  that  jealousy  and  distrust,  pe peculiar  culiar peculiar  to  a  free  people  were  manifested,  lest  the  accused  should  harbour  any  pretensions,  as  son  of  the  Sovereign,  inconsistent  with  the  spirit  of  the  constitution  and  the  equality  of  our  laws.  This  pertinacious  adherence,  on  the  part  of  the  Public  to  a  rigid  maintenance  of  their  rights,  proves  them  deserving  of  the  freedom  they  enjoy;  and  that  every  member  of  the  community  is  equally  amenable  to  the  laws  is  the  highest  triumph  of  poli political  tical political  philosophy.  We  have  considered  the  conduct  of  his  Royal  Highness  only  in  a  political  point  of  view  ;  and  not  in  a  moral  one.  We  have  not  adverted  to  the  indecency  and  profligacy  of  a  married  man,  filling  one  of  the  highest  ostensible  situations  in  the  country,  liv living  ing living  publicly  with  a  concubine,  and  expending  immense  sums  for  her  establishment,  whilst  thousands  of  honest  industrious  fami families  lies families  in  the  manufacturing  towns  were  literally  starving.  Ile  dis disca:ded  ca:ded disca:ded  her  at  last,  but  not  from  a  convictiou  of  the  irregularity  of  his  conduct,  or  from  a  sense  of  the  indecent  example  he  fur furnished  nished furnished  ;  but  from  satiety  ;  for  he  immediately  associated  w  itli  another  woman,  whom  he  stipported  at  the  same  immoderate  expence  ;  not  reflecting  that  the  sums  he  expended  on  so  despic despicable  able despicable  an  object,  might  have  clothed  and  educated  500  destitute  children.  What  a  godlike  sensation  to  a  liberal,  generous,  and  feeling  mind  must  an  expenditure  of  the  latter  description  have  afforded  !

Milton's  4 STYLE=superscript  SUMSO7B  DUKE  OF  YORK.  Frtrnertrem,  Duke  of  York  and  Albany  in  Great  Britain,  and  Earl  Zif  Ulster  in  Ireland,  is  the  second  son  of  their  pre present  sent present  Majesties.  Ile  was  born  on  the  16th  of  August,  in  the  year  176.3  ;  exactly  four  days  after  the  birth  of  his  eldest  brother  daring  the  preceding  year.  Always  beloved  by  his  All:'11St  Parent,  the  Duke  of  York  succeNted  rapid rapidly  ly rapidly  to  the  honours  and  dignities  which  have  been  conferred  upon  him;  and  which  virtually,  though  not  actually,  coo coo%tante  %tante coo%tante  him,  as  one  of  our  representatives  in  parliament,  is  stated  to  have  called  him,  no  less  than  the  second  person personage  age personage  in  this  kingdom.  lie  has  proved,  indeed,  that  respon responsibility  sibility responsibility  and  authority  are  inseparable.  Scarcely  had  his  Royal  Highness  completed  his  fourth  year,  when,  on  the  death  of  the  Great  Duke  of  Cumber Cumberland,  land, Cumberland,  he  was  appointed  to  succeed  him  as  Grand-Master  and  First  Knight-Compaction  of  the  Order  of  the  Bath.  He  obtained  the  Order  of  the  Garter  in  the  year  1771.  He  was  raised  to  the  ran's:of  Colonel  in  the  army  in  1760;  and  on  the  decease  of  Lord  Amherst,  about  1799,  his  Royal  Highness  was  finally  entrusted  with  the  high  post  of  Com Commander  mander Commander  in  Chief  of  the  British  Army.  lie  had  previously  enjoyed  all  the  supposed  advantages  of  military  education,  both  at  home  and  abroad  ;  while,  by  the  active  part  which  he  hail  taken,  during  the  early  stages  of  the  revolution,  against  the  enemies  of  this  country,  he  was  understood  to  have  become  practically,  as  well  as  theoretically,  ac acquainted  quainted acquainted  with  his  professional  duties.

With  the  best  pos possible  sible possible  intentions  to  serve  his  country,  his  exertions,  it  w  i  ll  hardly  be  denied,  have  been  singularly  unsuccessful  ;  and  have,  very  unauspiciously  for  the  country  as  well  as  un unhappily  happily unhappily  for  himself,  created  such  prepossessions  as  seem  completely  to  preclude  him  from  attempting  to  retrieve  his  military  reputation,  and  from  establishing,  as  other otherwise  wise otherwise  he  possibly  might,  his  character.  Singular  though  the  opinion  may  appear.  to  others,  I  confess  myself  to  be  one  of  those,  who,  from  conclusions  which  cannot  be  soon  made  obvious  to  the  many,  regret  that  the  Duke  of  York,  notwithstanding  his  former  reverses,  was  not  permitted  to  have  commanded  the  forces  lately  sent  from  this  country  to  the  assistance  of  Portugal.

Where  was  otherwise  the  necessity  for  his  mingling,  with  his  amatory  intercourse,  an  account  of  his  visiting  the  works  at  Dover,  of  his  reviewing,;  the  troops  there,  and  exemining  the  coast  as  far  as  Sandgate  and  of  his  setting  off  immediately  to  along  the  coast  to  Hastings,  reviewing  the  different  as  he  passed,  which  would  again  occupy  him,  at  least,  thirteen  hours  This  does  not  seem  to  be  the  confi confidential  dential confidential  letter-writing  of  one  who  is  neglectful  of  his  public  duties.

Assuming  it  as  granted,  however,  that  the  Duke  of  York  feels  himself  perfectly  free  from  the  charges  which  have  recently  been  preferred  against  him,  I  consider  him  rather  misadvised  in  the  formation  of  the  Letter  communi communicated  cated communicated  from  him  to  the  House  of  Commons.  He  therein  concedes  too  much  respecting  himself,  but  too  little  as  it  affects  his  country.  Instead  of  intimating  the  hope  that  the  House  of  Commons  will  not,  upon  such  evidence  as  they  have  heard,  adopt  any  proceeding  prejudicial  his  own  honour  and  and  submitting  himself  to  the  ordinary  forms  of  jurisprudence,  observed  as  to  similar  impeachments,  only  if,  on  such  testimony  as  has  been,  adduced  him,  the  House  of  Commons  can  his  innocence  instead  of  this  line  of  conduct,  which  more  than  insinuates  the  utter  falsity  of  his  accusers,  and  seems  to  petition  the  clemency  of  his  present  judges,  how  truly  would  it  become  his  Royal  Highness,.  whether  as  it  refers  to  the  honour  of  his  country  or  the  welfare  of  his  family,  to  step  boldly'  forward,  and,  be  the  vote  of  the  Commons  what  it  may,  still  demand  an  open  trial  before  his  Peers  !  It  is  here,  therefore,  that  he  acts  as  if  he  was  not  strictly  admonished  to  consult  the  opinion  of  the  country.  With  respect  to  his  private  amours,  he  has  conceded  more  than  any  rational  person  could  have  desired.  While  his  Royal  Highness  did  observe,  with  the  deepest  con 'concern,'  his  name  coupled  with  transactions  the  most  criminal  and  there  yet  appeared  no  absolute  necessity  for  him  so  publicly  to  regret  and  lament  that  a  connection  should  ever  have  existed  which  has  thus  ex 'exposed'  his  character  and  honour  to  public  animadver 'animadversion.'  No  man  thus  exacted  from  him  the  part  of  the  repenting  Efrodigal.  His  own  personal  dignity  seems  to  have  been  attended  to  as  little  as  the  satisfaction  of  be  public.

I  regret,  therefore,  let  me  repeat  it,  that,  instead  of  being  detained  at  home  to  meet  the  charges  of  courtesans,  the  Commander  in  Chief  was  not  sent  abroad  to  encounter  the  enemies  of  his  country.

There  is  some  reason  to  indulge  this  opinion,  when,  as  it  confessedly  appears,  we  reflect  that  to  amatory  mistakes  we  must  impute  Hiany  of  our  military  errors.

Mrs.  Clarke  only  informed  him,  that  the  oc occurrence  currence occurrence  arose  from  a  mistake,  but  she  could  explain  no  further..

The  Enquiry  he  must  contend  to  be  ;  the  tribunal  before  which  it  took  place  was  incompetent,  and  inconsistent  with  all  the  known  forms  of  law  and  equity  on  military  subjects.

But  if  the  mere  possession  of  Lisbon  aml•Portagal  was  the  object,  it  was  certainly  one  of  doubtful  policy  ;  for  till  the  French  were  expelled  from  Spain,  such  possession  must  always  remain  insecure  ;  and  of  all  the  calamities  that  could  nillict  a  country,  that  of  merely  reconquering  it,  while  we  cannot  retain  it,  was  one  of  the  greatest.

And  hence  the  country  had  to  lament  that  convention,  which  transferred  a  French  army  from  Portugal  into  Spain,  the  principal  scene  of  action;  which  made  that  efficient  which  was  actually  locked  up  ;  'whilst  the  usual  expectations  of  the  country  were  disappointed,  and  the  honour  of  our  military  character  was  tarnished,  by  our  agreeing  to  a  Convention  with  an  army  that  had  been  twice  beaten,  while  we  had  30,000  troops  in  the  field.  The  Noble  Lord  then  addressing  the  Speaker,  observed,  You,  Sir,  in  one  of  your  eloquent  ad addresses  dresses addresses  to  the  Officers  who  had  distinguished  themselves  in  Por Portugal,  tugal, Portugal,  said  that  their  swords  had  not.  been  drawn  in  It  'was  true,  that  they  had  gained  themselves  distinguished  honour.  said  the  Noble  Lord,  I  would  ask  of  the  people  of  Spain,  of  the  people  of  Biscay,  who  have  tracked  the  desolat desolattug  tug desolattug  footsteps  of  that  very  army  which  you  released  from  Portu Portugal,  gal, Portugal,  to  send  it  to  the  very  scene  of  action,  whether  the  British  sword  had  been  drawn  in  vain  ?  I  would  ask  our  countrymen,  who  lost  their  last  blood  at  the  battle  of  Corunna,  who  were  the  troops  that  followed  up  their  retreat,  and  harrassed  their  march  ?  They  would  answer,  the  very  army  of  Junut,  which  the  Convention  had  released.  I  would  ask  the  gallant  regiment  who  took  the  only  French  General  that  was  taken  in  the  battle  of  Corunna,  and  they  would  tell  me  they  had  the  misfortutie  to  find  him  a  General  released  by  that  Convention.  I  would  ask  the  people  of  Portugal,  whoa)  you  are  now  compelled  to  aban abandon,  don, abandon,  or  have  already  abandoned,  whether,  as  to  them  at  least,  the  British  sword  has  not  been  dram'  in  vain.  The  Noble  Lord  then  concluded  a  very  able  and  brilliant  speech  by  moving,  as  his  first  ResOlution,  Thai  the  Convention  of  Cintra  had  disappointed  the  just  hopes  and  expectations  of  the  If  nose  and  of  the  Lord  CASTLEtt  E.t  expressed  his  high  satisfaction  that  the  moment  was  now  arrived  when  'his  Majesty's  Ministers  would  have  an  opportunity  of  explaining  their  motives,  and  justifying  their  conduct  with  respect  to  the  late  expedition  to  Portugal.  It  appeared  that,  small  as  the  force  was,  under  General  Sir  Arthur  Wellesley,  it  might  be  - STYLE=superscript  applied,  in  the  mean  time  to  some  important  object,  and  they  therefore  did  not  wait  till  the  additional  ten  thousaad  troops  should  be  ready  to  join  them;  and  he  did  not  believe  that  the  Noble  Lord  himself  would  have  advised  them  to  keep  the  force  under  Sir  Arthur  Wellesley,  joined  by  the  troops,  as  they  were  to  he,  from  Gibraltar,  under  General  Spencer,  in  a  state  of  total  inattivity,  till  this  additi additional  onal additional  embarkation  was  ready,  when  there  was  such  immediate  and  pressing  demand  for  assistance,  both  in  Spain  and  Portu Portugal.  gal.

In  such  circumstances  it  was  thought  most  advisable  to  allow  the  General  some  discretionary  power,  who  would  be  best  able  to  judge  where  his  services  might  he  most  useful,  from  his  vicinity  to  the  scene  of  operations,  and  shifting  every  day,  as  that  scene  necessarily  was,  though  at  the  same  time  the  'ob 'object  ject 'object  of  the  ex  pedition  was  by  no  means  left  undefined.

The  Junta  in  Spain,  instead  of  asking  our  assistance  for  themselves,  in  preference  to  Portugal,  approved,  on  the  contrary,  of  assisting  the  latter  Power,  and  had  given  it  as  their  opinion,  that  our  force  would  be  able  to  contribute  more  to  the  general  cause  by  opposing  the  enemy  in  Portugal,  and  driving  'him  out  of  that  country,'  than  by  any  assistance  that  could  be  given  to  themselves  in  the  circumstances  they  then  were  The  Noble  Lord  then  adverted  at  great  length  to  the  equipment  of  the  expedition,  and  contended  that  in  every  respect  it  was  perfectly  adequateto  the  nature  of  the  service  for  which  it  vvas  designed.  It  had  provisions  for  three  mouths,  besides  provi provisions  sions provisions  for  other  two  months  on  board  the  transports.  The  only  difficulty  to  be  experienced,  was  in  procuring  the  means  of  car carrying  rying carrying  with  them  the  necessary  stores  and  provisions  on  landing,  and  this,  from  the  very  nature  of  the  service,  must  have  been  trusted  to  the  resources  of  the  country  that  was  to  become  the  scene  of  their  operations.  nail  horses  been  provided  ..for  ail  thew  necessary  pniposes  ,  anti  formed  a  part  of  the  equ  ipme  nt.  his  Lordship  provCd,  that,  for  any  army  of  thirty  thousand  men,  not  less  than  fifteen  thousand  horses  would  have  been  necessary.  The  Noble  Lord  denied  that  any  inconveniency  had  been  expe experieuced  rieuced experieuced  from  the  want  of  heavy  artillery,  and  concluded  by  moving  the  previous  question,  but  stated,  that  he  should  after  wards  take  the  sense  of  the  House  on  the  propriety  and  prin..  ciple  of  the  expedition.  Sir  Attrncu  W  R  ILE'  LEY  thought  that  Administration  who  had  resolved  upon  the  expedition  responsible  for  their  resolution  ;  but  that  the  otlicers  who  conducted  it  alone  were  responsible  fur  its  operations.

It  was  his  t;pinion,  as  well  as  that  of  officers  under  his  orders,  that  the  French  would  endeavour  to  cross  the  Tagus,  and  the  plan  of  operations  he  had  suggested,  would  have  completely.  counteracted  that  measure,  as,  had  they  been  followed  up  in  lime  after  fte  battle  of  the  '2lst,  the  project  of  crossing  the  river  would  have  been  impractittble.  lie  stated,  that  when  he  left  town,  he  did  not  expect  to  remain  long  in  the  chief  command,  whatever  kindness  he  might  receive  from  his  Noble  Friend  near  him;  but  lie  hoped  Ministers  would  in  future  act  with  more  con consideration  sideration consideration  in  superseding  an  officer  who  may  go  on  an  expedition,  in  the.  middle  of  his  operations  (Hear!  hear!).  Although  his  opinion  was  contrary  to  that  of  Sir  11.  Burrard,  he  wished  by.  no  means  to  be  considered  as  the  accuser  of  that  Officer.

As  to  tin:,  Court  of  Enquiry,  before  which  he  had  been  called,  he  trusted  that  it  would  be  the  last  that  would  ever  sit  in  this  country,  as  its  proceedings  could  never  give  satisfaction  like  a  Court  Martial.  Mr.  W  it  !THREAD  said,  that  Ministers  had  received  an  attack  during  the  debate  which  they  could  not  effectually  resist  whit  all  their  troops.  At  one  time  they  had  told  the  puhiic  that  the  Treaty  of  (Intro  bad  disappointed  the  hopes  of  the  nation,  and  they  came  forward,  on  cool  reflection,  to  inform  the  Douse,  that  the  disapprobation  expre.sed  against  that  treaty  wits  not  well  founded.  A  gallant  General  on  the  other  side  of  the  Douse  had  said,  if  his  opinion  had  been  followed,  that  the  French  would  have  been  expelled  front  Portugal,  yet  he  would  not  vote  ag  ainst  the  Treaty.  The  Noble  Lord  (  ('  astiereegh)  had  acknowledgof  that  the  treaty  had  met  the  displeasure  of  the  country,  and  res.  fused  to  vote  ag  ainst  it,  because  the  Noble  lord  knew  that  the  blame  must  fall  on  'Ministers.  The  mistakes  and  blunders  of  Ministers  required  explanation.  The  people  of  England  had  a  right  to  be  satisfied,  and  they  ought  to  he  satisfied.

As  to  the  general  character  of  the  course  adopted  by  his  * STYLE=superscript  Majesty's  Ministers,  with  respect  to  assisting  Spain,  I  must  mo.  , STYLE=superscript  t  posi positively  tively positively  say,  that  /  conceived  it  to  have  been  dearly  pointed  out  by  all  the  public  feeling,  and,  as  far  as  it  could  be  expressed  and  collected,  by  all  the  public  opinion.  It  was  a  very  preva prevalent  lent prevalent  fallacy  to  judge  of  the  Spanish  people  upon  English  ideas  and  notions?  The  Spanish  people  wanted  no  political  -reforms,  and  it  certainly  did  not  become  the  English  to  impose  them,  The  English  were  not  conquerors.  The  main  question  with  his  Majesty's  Ministers  was,  was  there  any  grounds  for  believing  that  the  pe  o  ple  were  zealous  in  their  own  cause,  that  they  were  animated  azaiust  their  invaders  :  his  Majesty's  Ministers  made  these  inquiries,  and  they  had  reason  to  be  satisfied  with  the  re.  suit.  I  have  often  understood  it  as  one  of  the  favourite  maxims  of  Opposition,  that  a  country  united  in  itself  was  invincible,  and  that  nothing  could  resist  a  people  in  their  own  cause.  Sir,  the  Spaniards  Were  an  united  people.  I  cannot  consent  that  this  country  should  voluntary  take  so  low  a  rank  amongst  military  nation:,  as  to  tight  by  her  money  rather  than  by  her  arms—to  subsidize  a  nation  rather  than  become  its  ally.  shall  not  enter  into  a  further  detail,  as  I  conceive  I  have  suf.  ficiently  answered  all  the  Hon.  Gentleman's  arguments  on  the  point  of  delay.  If  the  delay  was  any  where,  it  was  in  the  Central  Junta.  The  English  soldiers  would  not  be  debarked  till  they  had  obtained  the  regular  permission  from  the  Central  Junta.  It  is,  indeed,  too  true,  and  a  most  melancholy  truth  it  is,  that  the  Spaniards  have  suffered  .the  greatest  misfortunes—that  her  armies  have  been  routed,  and  her  best  Generals  defeated  ;  but  I  cannot  persuade  myself  to  enter  into  too  free  a  criticism  as  to  the  cause  of  these  disasters.  If  he  really  thinks  that  the  British  arms  were  so  disgraced  in  Spain,  if  it  be  his  real  Opinion  that  the  disgrace  of  the  battle  of  Vimiera  can  never  be  wiped  away,  and  that  the  battle  of  Corunna  will  re remain  main remain  an  indelible  disgrace  on  the  recording  annals  of  the  court,  try,  if  such,  I  say,  Sir,  he  his  sentiments,  I  can  only  express  my  astonishment  at  his  way  of  thinking,  and  congratulate  mys..lf  that  I  so  widely  differ  from  him.

A  long  discussion  then  ensued,  in  which  Mr.  Windham,  Earl  Percy,  Mr.  Hutchinson,  and  Lord  Temple,  pressed  the  Inquiry,  Sir  Ponsonhy  having  replied  at  considerable  length,  the  House  divided,  —For  the  Motion  127—Against  it  20—Majority  93  Adjourned.

No  Ministers  ever  entered  under  such  favourable  4ud  such  auspicious  appearances  on  the  .ext  cation  of  their  pfficial  tinges;  party  spirit  was  extingaished;  and  there  was  pot  to  be  found,  throughout  the  country,  a  man  who  would  eipress.  hut  on  e  op  i  n  i  on  ,  name  l  y,  that  the  powers  of  Lugland  should  be  directed  in  the  most  effective  manner  to toiyakds  iyakds toiyakds  the  service  and  assistance  of  the  powers  of  Spain.  But  it  was  their  duty,  before  they  applied  the  wealth  or  force  of  their  country  for  the  prosecution  of  any  project,  to  have  well  understood  the  .  real  situation  of  Spain.  Ministers  were  responsible  not  alone  for  the  means  to  be  exerted  fur  the  assist assistqnce  qnce assistqnce  of  Spain,  but  also  for  the  defence  of  England.

This  is  to  consist  in  frequent  and  partial  descents  on  the  extensive  line  of  coast  from  Bayonne  to  Genoa.  its  expediency  and  advantages  were  frequently  recommended  by  the  great  Lord  N  ILSON  /  and  the  alarm  which  Lord  Cocii.a.vst:  - STYLE=superscript  kept  up,  sonic  time  ago  on  the  French  coast  in  the  Mediteraneith  prdves,  if  it  be  pursued  on  a  large  scale,  that  nothing  can  contribute  inure  to  harm%  and  distract  the  enemy.

0017,"POLITICAL  EVENTS  OP  THE  WEEK.  Friday  a  Messenger  arrived  from  Gottenburgh  with  dispatches  from  Stockholm.  The  contents  hale  not  trans transpired  pired transpired  ;  but  one  fact  is  stated  on  the  ii:sisencer's  authority,  which  is  of  importance,  at  least  as  indicating  the  state  of  the  public  mind  at  St.  Petersburgh.  The  character  of  the  Grand  Duke  CONSTANTINE,  and  the  estimation  in  which  he  is  held  by  the  better  order  of  the  Russian  people,  are  well  known.  His  low  habits  of  hie,  and  coarse  vices,  have  long  rendered  hint  offensive  to  the  higher  classes  of  the  inhabitants  of  St.  Vctersburgh.  The  disgust  which  has  been  felt  at  his  conduct  has  at  length  oc occasioned  casioned occasioned  an  attempt  upon  his  lite.  The  accounts  are  not  exactly  consistent  concerning  the  mode  of  the  attack.--  tonne  say  that  the  Duke  was  shot  at,  and  that  the  ball  passed  over  his  head,  and  killed  the  Aide-de-Camp.  Others  pretend  that  a  plot  was  formed  to  kill  him  in  his  bed,  and  that  his  room  being  mistaken,  his  Aide-de-Camp  was  slain  in  his  place  ;  but  all  accounts  agree  that  the  Aide-de-Cainp  lost  his  life  contrary  to  the  intention  of  the  conspirators.  In  consequence  of  this  attempt,  the  EMPEROR,  it  is  added,  offered  a  reward  of  200,000  rubles,  on  the  discovery  of  the  offender.  This  was  announced  by  placards  on  the  walls  of  the  city.  The  following  day  an  advertisement  was  posted  about  the  streets,  offering  400,000  roubles  to  any  one  who  should  assassinate  CONSTANTINE..  The  letters  from  Gottenburgh  announce  the  loss  of  two  ships  of  war  in  the  Baltic  ;  one  of  them  is  reported  to  be  the  Salcette  frigate.  By  the  last  accounts  from  the  Salcette,  there  had  been  little  or  no  communication  between  that  vessel  and  the  shore.  We  know  not  whether  Government  has  any  direct  com communications  munications communications  with  the  Cabinet  of  Vienna;  but  we  arc  in inclined  clined inclined  to  believe  it  has,  and  ground  this  supposition  on  the  arrival  in  this  country,  sonic  months  ago,  of  the  confiden confidential  tial confidential  Secretary  of  M.

Ail  the  accounts  from  Span  and  Portugal  coincide  in  stating  that  a  general  move:neat  has  been  made  by  all  the  French  armies  towards  the  Pyrenees.  If  this  statement  can  be  relied  on,  the  various  reports  w  hick  have  been  circulatei,  for  some  days,  relative  to  a  war  between  France  and  Austria,  obtain  the  highest  degree  of  credibility.  The  concurring  circumstance  of  Bosr  Al'  arc's  departure  for  Paris,  and  his  rumoured  arrival  at  Strasburgh,  give  thi  s  event  a  still  greater  portion  of  probability.  if  Austria  has  resolved  to  seize  the  present  auspicious  interval,  to  make  ore  build  and  decisive  push  for  her  own  independence,  the  tyrant  has  been  completely  outwitted,  and  all  his  battles  must  be  refonght,  and  his  marches  must  be  recommenced,  with  soldiers  harassed,  reluctant,  and  worn  out  ;  whilst  Austria  appears  on  the  field  with  fresh  and  renovated  strength,  conscious  of  the  sacredness  of  her  cause,  and  im impressed  pressed impressed  with  the  solemn  conviction  that  this  is  the  last  ef effort  fort effort  she  cant  make,  if  unsuccessful.

This  may  be  relied  on  ;  that  exactions  and  contributions  and  tyranny,  with  their  concomitant  train  of  private  and  public  misery,  have  worked  up  the  minds  of  the  Germans  to  a  pitch  bordering  on  frenzy  ;  and  they  are  prepared  to  undertake  and  perform  every  thing  which  despair  and  rage,  and  a  seuae  of  excessive  outrages  can  inspire.  —This  feeling  is  not  confined  to  Austrians  and  Prussians;  it  rages  through  every  town  and  village,  forming  formerly  a  part  of  the  ancient  Germanic  Body.

0024,"MR.  SHERIDAN.  The  disgraceful  subject  of  our  reverses  during  the  Late  campaign  was  discussed  in  the  House  of  Commons  last  night.  Between  eleven  and  twelve  o'clock,  the  fire,  which  was'consuming,  that  magnificent  temple  of  the  mimic  art,  Drury  Lane  Theatre,  had  reflected  so  strong  a  blaze  of  light  into  the  inside  of  the  House,  that  a  very  marked  agitation  was  visili!e  among  the  members  ;  and  the  Debate  Was  frequently'  interrupted.  At  the  conclusion  of  Mr.  Canning's  eli2  .  iient  and  patriotic  speech,  a  motion  was  made  to  adjourn  the  House,  as  a  marls  of  the  sympathy  and  interest  sr  hich  the  Members  felt  for  the  loss  sustained  by  Mr.  SuFainAs,  But  that  gentleman,  with  a  magnanimity  so  conspicuous  in  almost  all  his  public  actions,  had  re remained  mained remained  firm  and  immoveable  at  his  post,  though  his  whole  fortune  was  vested  in  the  theatre.  He  declared  to  the  House,  in  a  lo'w  tone  of  voice,  not  so  much  occasioned  by  the  great  loss  he  had  sustained,  but  from  the  strong  affect  this  general  sympathy  eel's:A  him,  that  however  great  the  sulThrings  of  the  individual  may  be,  he  did  not  consider  them  of  a  nature  to  ealbarrass  their  proceedings  on  so  great  a  national  question.

But  the  public  and.t  he  government  cannot  disregard  the  great  and  important  sers  ices  he  •  has  rendered.  His  conduct  during  the  mutiny  of  the  Nom,  when  the  fortunes  of  the  Empire  were  suspended  by  a  single  hair,  have  entitled  him  to  the  eternal  gratitude  of  the  country.

At  this  moment,  Mr.  Peake,  the  Treasurer,  arrived  in  a  state  of  agitation  not  easily  to  he  described,  and,  aouinst  the  repeated  advice  of  his  friends,  resolutely  went  to  the  Treasury,  and  succeeded  is  getting  away  other  private  papers.  The  Theatre  was  at  this  time  kft  to  .ts  fate,  and  the  appearance  was  most  awfully  and  tremendously  grand.  Never  before  did  we  behold  so  immense  a  body  of  flame,  and  the  occasional  ex  pinrions  that  took  place  were  awful  in  ap  pearatire  beyond  description.

Shortly  after  one  o'clock  the  chief  part  of  the  front  in  Russell  and  Brydges-street  fell  in  with  a  horrible  crash,  and  before  two,  the  side  in  Vinegar-yard  fell  with  a  dreadful  noise,  in  an  uut-  ward  direction.  About  twelve  o'clock  intelligence  of  the  conflagration  reached  the  House  of  Commons.  The  fire  was  then  rngin4  with  the  greatest  fury,  and  distinctly  visible  from  the  gatiry  windows.  Several  oft  he  Members  quitted  the  llouse  and  went  upon  West Westminster  minster Westminster  Bridge  to  view  the  flames,  w  164  h,  from  that  point  pre presented  sented presented  a  spectacle  more  sublimely  terrific  than  au)  that  11;ss  been  witnessed  in  this  capital  since  the  fire  of  1606.  Those  w  tw  s  re reci►llect  ci►llect reci►llect  how  beautiful  and  conspicuous  an  object  the  Theatre  ap appeared  peared appeared  from  the  bridge,  may  form  some  coneepti;m  of  the  aw.  ful  spectacle  it  exhibited  glowing  in  every  part  wit  it  ignited  matter.  The  horizon  was  so  illumined  with  the  flames,  that  every  steeple  from  Whitechapel  to  Westmint.ter  Abbey  was  as'  visible  as  at  noon  day  ;  and  the  reflection  of  so  immense  a  bialy  of  light  on  the  river  considerably  added  to  the  anoint  Arany  .  deur  of  the  scene.  It  was  in  truth  a  compliment  of  the  highest  tuttnre  to  Sir  ridan,  ho  %vas  in  the  House,  that  the  representati.e.  at  British  people  should  participate  in  his  distresl:,  and  lapat..i.re  in  his  feelings.  Air.  W.  Elliot  and  Lord  Temple  suggested  the  proprirt‘  of  au  adjournment,  in  consideration  af  the  great  personal  cal.,  which  the  house  had  been  just  informed  hail  befallen  a  Right  Hon.  Gent.  (Mr.  Sheridan)  for  whom  every  one  must  feel.  lir.  Sheridan  in  a  low  tone  of  voice,  and  e%  i  dent!  y  auxit  af affected,  fected, affected,  said  he  did  not  think  the  wisfortnue  which  had  happened  to  himself  was  of  a  proper  !sawn,  to  interrupt  the  procteaings  of  the  !louse.  This  sentiment  was  with  difficulty  acquiesced  its  and  the  debate  proceeded.  We  rejoice  to  state  that  the  fire  extended  no  further  than  the  ruins  of  the  Theatre,  with  the  exception  of  stltuc  slight  damage  done  to  Mr.  Beath's  oyster-shop,  and  Nathan's  fruit-shop,  in  Vinegar-yard,  which  was  occasioned  by  the  falling  of  the  %%alit  of  the  Theatre  in  that  direction.  Some  of  the  houses  partially  caught  fire  in  Russel-street,  hut  the  engines  with  a  plentiful  sup supply  ply supply  of  water,  continued  to  play  on  the  houses  contiguous  to  the  Theatre.  The  walls  ia  every  quarter  have  been  oKerwhelemed  t  with  the  exception  of  those  caustituting  the  cast  end,  towards  Drury-lane.  It  turns  out  that  the  edifice  was  erected  on  timber  piers,  cased  with  stone.  The  destruetiou  of  the  whole  building  is  of  course  easily  accounted  fur.

An  appearance  of  fire,  at  about  a  quarter  after  eleven  o'clock,  is  said  to  have  been  perceived  at  a  window,  on  the  second  story  of  this  building,  fronting  Russel-street,  without  exciting  any  properdegree  of  apprehension,  till,  about  twenty  minutes  after afterwards,  wards, afterwards,  the  entire  upper  part  of  the  theatre  burst  into  one  tremendous  burning  !

According  to  the  origin:it  pl:in  Of  the  Theatre  this  Chinese  lobby  was  intended  to  he  surrounded  ttith  shops,  for  the  sale  of  various  articles,  s  uch  ac  g  10%1'  4 STYLE=superscript  ,  fruits,  e‘c.  during  the  performance.  The  shops  had  actually  been  made  since  the  opening  of  the  Theatre,  but  they  remaioell  shut  up  with  shutter=,  never  having  been  finished  or  opened  for  actual  use.  This  lobby  from  the  beginning  was  a  /.cnurite  tos  of  Mr.  Sheridan.  who  at  the  commencement  of  the  Theatre,  and  often  sluice  has  been  heard  to  bohst  what  a  pretty  thing  It  'I%  (mid  he  when  finished  and  opened  in  complete  style.  To  accomplish  this  had  only  been  determined  this  season,  during  the  w  hole  of  w  hich  the  entrance  to  the  Theatre  from  itrydgei.  street  has  been  shut  up,  that  this  lobby  and  the  bhops  in  it  might  be  finished  and.  opened.  It  was  nearly  ready,  the  varnishers  More  at  work  rather  late  I;.A  night,  and  from  negligence  the  fire  FEB.  26  happened.  lloa  it  happened  is  not  exactly  known;  but  it  is  known  that  the  varnish  caught  fire,  and  that  almost  instantly  the  whole  Theatre  was  in  a  blaze;  the  varnish  being  such  combust'.  ble  matter,  newly  laid  on  the'  walls.  The  metropolis  was  illuminated  to  the  remotest  parts  of  the  town,  and  the  intelligence  of  We  stile  of  the  calamity  seemed  to  spread  with  equal  rapidity,  as  people  from  all  parts  came  Hock Hockiag  iag Hockiag  towards  the  melancholy  scene  of  action,  as  to  a  central  , STYLE=superscript  point.  The  erotic]  near  the  fatal  spot  was  imincose,  and  all  the  streets  leading  to  it  were  thronged  with  people,  yet  perhaps  there  is  no  instance  on  record  in  which  there  appeared  less  tur turbulence  bulence turbulence  and  confusion.  As  far  as  it  was  possible  to  detach  the  mind  of  the  spectators  from  the  awful  and  tremendous  calamity  in  view,  the  appearance  of  the  metropolis  was  in  the  highest  degree  striking  and  magnificent.  The  tops  of  the  hoftes  r  all  directions  were  covered  with  people,  and  those  who  stood  upon  any  house,  from  which  a  view  of  Westminster  and  I'luckf;  iars  Bridges  could  be  seen,  could  see  every  passenger  go  over  them,  and  distinctly  mark  the  ballustrade,:.

Any  attempt  to  go  near  the  flames  was  totally  impracticahle--and  all  that  was  ca  ved  from  ruin  was  done  by  the  presence  of  mind  and  activity  of  Mr.  Kent,  who  was  the  first  to  discover  the  flames;  .Mr.  Powell,  the  prompter  ;  and  Mr.lohnston,  the  mechanist  ;  with  the  two  waf  ehme”.
