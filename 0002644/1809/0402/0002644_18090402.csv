0001,"POLITICAL  DISQUISITION.  NUMBER  SIXTY-FOUR.  ....gasimip...  THE  SPT!UT  OF  TILE  TIME;  AND  SOME  HINTS  TO  PRINCES  AND  THEIR  ADVISERS.  ---allow--  The  ivorst  and  the  most  obvious  evil  of  the  French  revolution  is,  that  it  has  considerably  undermined  the  confidence  anti  vene veneration  ration veneration  of  mankind  for  their  institutions  and  princes.  The  stabi stability  lity stability  of  governments  rests  exclusively  on  the  :respectful  attach attachments  ments attachments  they  inspire  :  as  soon  as  that  foundation  is  removed,  the  artificial  props  of  standing  armies,  a  vigilant  police,  and  the  geverest  legal  restrictions,  will  not  be  able  to  protect  them  a  moment  against  the  first  violent  passion  which  ruffles  the  com community.  munity. community.  They  are  torn  away  by  the  storm,  and  the  edifice  crumbles  to  pieces.  This  great  political  convulsion  has  left  another  fatal  conse consequence  quence consequence  behind  it.  It  wound  up  the  feelings  and  passions  of  mankind  to  too  high  a  tone  ;  and  the  ardour  of  enthusiasm  has  been  followed  by  the  frigid  indifference  of  scepticism  ;—the  ravings  of  the  fever,  as  soon  as  the  paroxism  was  over;  were  followed  by  langour  acd  stppefaction.  In  political,  as  in  phy physical,  sical, physical,  maladies  this  is,  unquestionably,  the  most  desperate  stage,  the  most  dangerous  symptom  of  the  disorder;  and  all  the  art  of  the  statesman  is  requisite  to  resuscitate,  by  gentle  stimula stimulative,  tive, stimulative,  the  community  to  a  sense  of  life  and  feeling.  These  phenomena  are  accompanied  by  signs  equally  alarming.  The  individuals,  whose  virtue  and  talents  should  aftbrd  a  remedy  to  these  complicated  evils,  display  a  degree  of  levity  and'  weak weakness  ness weakness  even  superior  to  the  danger  which  menaces  them  in  parti particular.  cular. particular.  In  this  tremendous  crisis,  the  higher  classes  are  the  mast  insensible  and  vitiated  part  of  the  social  body.  We  shrink  back  with  horror  and  disgust  from  fife  contemplation  of  their  low  and  groveling  vices  ;  and,  though  the  very  ground  they  stand  on  trembles  under  their  feet,  they  pursue,  with  insatiable  avidity,  the  same  despicable  gratifications  which  plunged  the  nobility  and  princes  of  the  continent  into  an  abyss  of  misery  and  ruin.  All  the  signs  which  preceded  revolutions  in  any  age  or  country,  accumulate  in  ours;  they  terrify  from  abroad;  they  multiply  at  home;  and  whilst  the  closest  confederacy  of  the  good  and  in intelligent  telligent intelligent  can  scarce  prevent  the  explosion,  those  who  pOSSebS  qualities  of  that  description,  remain  isolated  and  inactive,  or  encourage,  through  mistaken  heal,  and  misunderstood  patriotism„  the  very  evils  it  is  so  much  their  duty  and  interest  to  repress.  Men,  who  love  their  country,  look  *out  them  with  despon despondency;  dency; despondency;  they  find  nothing  to  encourage;  every  thing  to  depress.  On  the  one  side,  an  inexorable,  bold,  and  inveterate  enemy,  wielding  the  immense  resources  of  twenty  kingdoms,  and  sue sueported  ported sueported  by  great  genius,  greater  villainy,  and  more  intense  hatred,  is  preparing,  with  unremitting  perseverance,  to  accom accomplish  plish accomplish  our  destruction.  On  the  other,  our  own  vices  and  folly  are  labouring  incessantly  t  to  accelerate  au  event,  the  most  dis disastrous  astrous disastrous  that  ever  occurred  in  the  annals  of  the  world;—if  England,  that  last  mid  favourite  sojourn  of  liberty  and  laws.  stoop  to  a  ruthless  tyrant,  freedom  and  humanity  tly  from  our  distracted  hemisphere  f►►r  ever.  Our  primitive  manners  are  gone,  and  with  them  our  energy  and  love  of  country.  To  re-establish  them  in  a  soil,  where  they  formerly  shot  out  with  so  much  luxuriance,  they  must  be  re replanted,  planted, replanted,  and  nurtured  by  the  domestic  virtues.  As  soon  as  the  parental  and  conjugal  duties  are  revered  and  exercised  by  the  higher  classes,  the  lower  v  ill  imitate  the  example.  The  fo  t  riner  Lt.-3  .

It  is  a  truism  almost  too  trite  to  repeat,  that  a  bad  private  man  can  never  be  a  good  public  one,  and  the  wretch  who  is  callous  enough  to  abundoa  a  wife  and  eight  children,  in  order  to  live  in  illicit  intercourse  with  the  wife  of  his  friend,  will  likewise  be  base  enough,  if  au  adequate  price  be  offered,  to  betray  the  interests  of  his  country.  These  are  the  Jacobins,  these  arc  the  conspirators  against  tip  House  of  Brunswick;  for  they  debauch  the  state,  and  undermine  its  security.  The  mass  of  the  people,  who  form  their  judgment;  more  from  feeling,  than  elaborate  reflection,  naturally  cease  to  venerate,  and  confide  in  men,  who  do  not  even  affect  to  lay  any  claim  to  their  respect.  The  same  conduct  and  sentiments  pro produced  duced produced  the  misfortunes  of  the  continent  ;  and  we  shudder  least,  when  the  crisis  arrives,  they  may  occasion  similar  disasters  in  this  country.  '  Our  voice  and  exertions  shall  never  he  wanting  to  scare,  or  drag  back  our  countrymen  from  the  precipice  on  which  they  are  standing.  We  will  touch  every  string,  to  hear  if  a  generous  toile,  will  vibrate.  We  will  remind  them  of  the  glory  and  virtue  of  their  ancestors;  we  will  contrast  England,  powerful,  opulent,  free,  and  respected,  with  her  situation  as  an  abject,  plundered,  and  enslaved  province.  How  !  are  these  reflections  too  gloomy  !  are  our  apprehensions  exaggerated  ?  The  same  fatal  security,  the  same  indifference  to  exhortation,  were  equally  prevalent  three  years  ago  at  Madrid,  Berlin,  and  Stockholm.  Awl  what  •  has  been  the  consequence?  a  foreigu  usurper  is  lording  it  over  one.  whilst  the  legitimate  Monarch  and  his  family  are  pining  in  French  captivity.  The  nobility,  whose  vices,  intrigues,  and  pretensions  hastened  the  catastrophe,  are  now  converted  into  i  the  suspec  ed  slaves  of  an  Upstart  they  must  hate  and  despis  e  ,  or  paying  with  their  blood  the  forfeit  of  their  former  remissness.  The  cowariliee  and  treachery  of  the  Prussian  Nobles  occasioned  the  overthrow  of  that  celebrated  monarchy  ;  and  the  Swedish  capital  has  lately  witnessed  the  atrocity  of  seeing  its  young  So Sovereign  vereign Sovereign  dragged  from  his  throne  to  a  prison  by  the  very  same  order.  If  a  generous  sacrifice  has  been  made  in  apy  of  these  countries,  it  was  almost  solely  performed  by  the  people.  Their  affection  and  loyalty:for  their  sovereigns  increased  is  proportion  to  their  misfortunes  ;  and  calumniated  and  oegleeted  as  they  were,  they  adhered  to  their  establishments,  when  they  mere  betrayed  apd  abandoned  by  the  rich.  The  views  of  modern  statesmen  are  limited  and  formal  ;  they  administer  by  mere  rote,  according  to  ordinary  forms,  without  diverging  into  eccentric  suggestions,  or  hitting  on  uncommon  expedients.  They  form  some  vulgar  plan,  and  they  vulgarly  pursue  it.  The  finesse  which  distinguished  the  ancient  school  is  unknown  to  ours.  Force  or  money,  (persuasion  Meyer),  arc  the  two  great  springs  which  move  at  present  the  whe.ls  of  govern government;  ment; government;  and  this  clumsy,  grating  operation,  is  the  primary  cause  that  the  people  begin  to  display  so  frigid  an  indifference  far  national  concerns.  There  is  something  in  it  of  the  brutality  with  which  a  haughty  individual  confers  a  favour;  it  alienates,  instead  of  conciliating  gratitude  or.  applause.  Tit?.  harshness  of  the  manner  precludes  the  possibility  of  affeetionon  the  part  of  the  people,  who  judge  actions  tuore  from  appearance  than  their  utility.  In  free  states,  the  secret  of  government  is  atrec-.  tion;  in  despotic  ones,  terror.  The  latter  has  been  frequently  the  former,  for  the  last  fifteen  years,  never  applied  ;  and  from  that  time  may  be  dated  the  apathy  of  the  multilutle.

Having  ascertained  that  they  were  securing  her  (by  springs  on  her  cables,  and  others  fast  to  the  trees  on  shore)  as  well  as  her  situation  would  permit,  I  made  every  preparation  for  attacking  her,  the  witid  being  at  this  time  from  the  s.  but  very  light  aid  variable.

VOTE  OF  THANKS  TO  COLONEL  WARDLE  AND  HIS  SUPPORTERS;  AND  VOTE  OF  CENStRE  ON  THE  LORD  MAYOR,  SIR  WILLIAM  crwris,silt  CHARLES  PRICE,AND  MR.ALDERMAN  SIIAW.  At  one  o'clock,  the  multitude  of  Liverymen  assembled  at  Guildhall  was  immense.  Immediately  on  the  LORD  AlAYOft  having  ascended  the  Hustings,  Mr.  WAITHMAN,  in  a  clear,  nervous,  and  manly  speech,  opened  the  business  of  the  Meeting,  and  concluded  by  submitting  the  following  very  spirited  Resolutions  to  the  consideration  of  the  Livery.  I.  Resolved,  That  it  long  been  a  matter  of  notoriety,  and  has  lately  been  proved  beyond  the  possibility  of  doubt,  that  Abuses  of  a  most  corrupt  nature  and  ruinous  tendency  have  ex existed,  isted, existed,  and  still  exist,  in  the  various  branches  of  the  administra administration  tion administration  of  Public  Affairs.  11.  Resolved,  That  to  detect  such  Abuses,  and  expose  to  de  testation  those  Men  who  have  wickedly  connived  at,  or  partici participated  pated participated  in  them,  requires  no  small  degree  of  Virtue,  Independence,  and  Patriotism  ;  all  of  which  have  been  eminently  displayed  by  Gwillim  Lloyd  Wardle,  r:q.  in  instituting  and  conducting  the  late  Inquiry  into  the  Conduct  of  his  Royal  Highness  the  Duke  of  York.  111.  Resolved,  That  he  is,  therefore,  entitled  to  the  Thanks  and  Gratitude  of  this  Common  Hall,  for  his  persevering  and  in independent  dependent independent  EflOrts,  which  have  already  produced  beneficial  Fl Fleets,  eets, Fleets,  and  arc  likely  to  lead  to  still  more  ad%  antageous  Results— Resultsand  and Resultsand  they  express  their  confidence,  that  having  so  manfully  and  ably  commenced  this  arduous  task,  no  difficulty  or  danger  will  damp  his  ardour,  or  impede  his  progress,  in  a  cause  so  honour honourable  able honourable  to  himself,  and  so  essential  to  the  best  Interests  of  his  Country.  IV.  Resolved,  That  upon  the  same  principles,  and  for  the  same  reasons,  they  do  highly  approve  of  the  conduct  of  Sir  Francis  Burdett,  Bart.  (the  Seconder),  Lord  V  iscount  Folk Folkstone,  stone, Folkstone,  Samuel  Whitbread,  Esq.  Sir  Samuel  Romilly,  Knt.  and  the  rest  of  the  One  Hundred  and  Twenty-five  honest  and  inde independent  pendent independent  Members,  who  supported  Mr.  Wardle's  Proposition  oo  the  15th  of  March,  1809,  and  trust,  that  uninfldenced  by  Party,  or  feelings  of  Interest,  they  will  support  every  Measure  calcu calculated  lated calculated  to  remove  and  root  out  Corruption.  V.  Resolved,  That  these  Abuses  form  only  a  part  of  a  wick wicked  ed wicked  and  corrupt  System,  which  has  been  long  acted  upon,  and  no  permanent  good  can  arise  from  the  late  Investigation,  unless  fol followed  lowed followed  up  by  a  general  Reformation  of  public  Abuses  in  every  Department  of  the  Slate.  cI.  keenl  ved,  That  the  Corporation  of  London  did,  in  peti petitions,  tions, petitions,  unanimously  agreed  to,  and  presented  to  both  !louses  of  Parliament  during  the  I&amp;.t  Sessions  state,  their  bnrthens  had  been  con:;iderably  augmented  by  gross  abuses,  in  the  ma 'ma'  rtagement  and  expenditure  of  the  Public  Money,—by  a  profit 'profit'  siim  of  sinceure  Places  and  Pcnsio►is,—which  hate  not  only  added  to  the  sutferinl:s  of  the  People,  bnt  created  a  pernicious  influence,  corrupting  and  undermining  the  free  principles  of  the  British  N  . STYLE=superscript  11.  Resolved,  That  no  measures  calculated  to  remove  theFe  opprebsicc  a:►d  alarming  evil,  ltme  been  'et  ,olopted,  CUR  APIA  L  1.  any  rational  expectation  be  formed,  that  such  measures  will  be  adopted,  while  the  management  of  public  affairs  is  in  the  hands  of  persons,  w  his  are  themselves  the  greatest  Pensioners  and  Re Reversionists  versionists Reversionists  in  the  kingdom.  Resolved,  That  it  has  since  appeared  by  a  Report  of  a  Com Committee  mittee Committee  of  the  house  of  Commons,  that  Seventy-eight  Members  of  that  House  are  in  the  receipt  of  178,9941.  per  annum,  out  of  the  public  money,  who,  with  their  Relations  and  the  Naval  and  Military  Officers  in  that  House,  must  give  a  most  preponderat preponderating  ing preponderating  and  destructive  influence  to  the  Ministers  of  the  Crown.  IX.  Resolved,  That  if  any  doubt  could  remain  as  to  the  bane baneful  ful baneful  effect  of  such  influence,  it  has  been  utliciently  exemplified  by  the  rejection  of  Mr.  Wardle's  late  proposition  in  Parliament  against  the  most  conclusive  evidence,  and  unequivocal  cmse  of  the  country  ;  and  where  it  appeared,  that  all  his  Majesty's  Minis Ministers,  ters, Ministers,  all  the  Placemen,  and  all  the  Pensioners  then  present,  (stated  to  be  eighty-two  in  number),  voted  against  the  said  Proposition;  while  of  course  in  the  minority  of  125,  not  one  Minister—not  one  Placeman—not  one  Pensioner--and  only  one  Naval  and  one  Military  Commander  was  to  be  fonfld.  X.  Resolved,  That  other  Governments  have  crumbled  into  ruin—other  States  have  been  subverted,  and  their  antient  and  venerable  Institutions  overthrown  by  the  folly,  profligacy,  and  vices  of  their  Rulers  :  and  in  the  opinion  of  this  Common  Hall,  unless  this  overwhelming  tide  of  Corruption  is  resisted  by  temper temperate  ate temperate  and  timely  Reformation,  it  must  inevitably  lead  to  the  ruin  and  subjugation  of  this  Country.  XI.  Resolved,  That  it  will  he  highly  expedient  for  the  Livery  of  London,  sometime  during  the  present  Session,  to  meet  for  the  purpose  of  laying  a  faithful  statement  of  their  Grievances  before  Parliament,  and  pray  for  redress  of  the  same.  XII.  Resolved,  That  the  Thanlcs  of  this  Common  Hall  be  given  to  Alderman  Coombe,  one  of  the  Representatives  for  this  City,  in  Parliament,  for  supporting  Mr.  Wardle's  Motion,  and  general  ineorruptable  comduct.  XIII.  Resolved,  That  Sir  William  Curtis,  Bart.  Sir  Charles  Price,  Bart.  and  James  Shaw,  Esq.  three  of  the  representatives  for  this  City  in  Parliament,  have  by  their  recent  Conduct  therein,  sliewn  a  contempt  and  disregard  for  the  Opinions  and  Interests  of  t`teir  Constituents,  a  bare  subserviency  to  the  will  of  Ministers,  and  are  therefore  unworthy  the  confidence  of  their  fellow  citizens.  XIV.  That  the  Thanks  of  this  Common  Hall  he  given  to  Robert  Waithman,  Esq.  for  his  manly  Conduct  in  this  instance;  and  for  his  zeal  and  firmness  on  all  occasions  where  the  interests  of  the  Livery  are  in  question.  XV.  Resolved,  That  the  Lord  Mayor  has,  by  refusing  to  con convene  vene convene  a  Common  Hall  on  three  different  Requisitions,  by  pre presuming  suming presuming  to  dictate  the  Terms  and  Object  of  the  present  Reqtti Reqtti;Rion,  ;Rion, Reqtti;Rion,  and  the  trouble  and  delay  he  created,  shewn  a  contempt  and  disregard  for  the  Rights  and  Privileges  of  the  Livery,  and  is  therefore  unworthy  the  Confidence  of  his  fellow  Citizens.  Mr.  ALDERMAN  CURTIS  came  forward  to  offer  himself  to  the  Livery,  but  the  disapprobation  was  so  loud  and  so  universal,  that  he  was  obliged  to  sit  down.  The  Lour)  M  IYOR  intreated  the  Livery  to  listen  with  pa patience  tience patience  to  what  every  Gentleman  might  have  to  offer  ;  on  which,  Mr.  Alderman  CURTIS  again  came  forward—The  clamour  and  interruption  were  again  renewed;  and,  after  a  few  obser observations,  vations, observations,  expressive  of  the  consciousness  of  his  motives,  he  retired,  amidst  an  universal  his  3,  accompanied  with  groaning.  Mr.  Quist,  in  a  very  able  speech,  next  addressed  the  Livery,  and  was  heard  with  profonnd  attention—he  concluded  by  con congratulating  gratulating congratulating  the  Meeting  on  their  having  an  opportunity  of  ex expressing  pressing expressing  their  sentiments.  Mr.  WA  mist  A  N  rose  again,  in  reply  to  an  observation  that  had  been  made  with  respect  to  the  'name  of  Mr.  HA  av  Coster,  not  having  been  included  in  the  Vote  of  Thanks,  which  he  proposed  to  introduce  in  a  distinct  Resolution.  A  Motion  was  then  made  to  thank  Mr.  Harvey  Combe,  which  was  carried  with  acclamation.—Mr.  Alderman  Combe  then  presented  himself  to  the  Livery,  and  was  received  with  the  loudest  cheering  and  applause.  On  the  Motion  by  Mr.WAITHMAN  %  that  in  consequence  of  the  refusal  and  delay  of  the  Lord  Mayor  in  calling  a  Common  Hall,  lie  had  lost  the  confidence  of  his  fellow  Citizens,  his  Lordship  declared  his  disapprobation  of  the  Resolation,  and  at  down  without  putting  the  question.  •  211  Mr.  WA  ifiIMAN  addressed  the  Meeting  with  great  auiina auiinaion,  ion, auiinaion,  and  stated  that  the  Lord  Mayor  refused  to  put  the  guts-  [on.  Mr.  Thiav  EV  CooMuC  expressed  extreme  indignation  at  the  conduct  of  his  LOrdship.  Mr.  Ro , STYLE=superscript  T  addressed  the  :11ecting—but  being  of  opi.  nion,  that  it  was  correct  that  the  Lord  Mayor  should  decide  on  the  propriety  of  a  Common  Hall,  was  not  suffered  to  proceed.  The  tumult  and  clamour  were  here  excessive.  At  length  the  Loan  MA  YO  rt  consented  to  put  the  question,  which  he  read  himself';  and  the  Vote  of  Censure  passed  with  the  dissent  of  about  four  hands,  amongst  almost  as  many  thousands.  The  huzas  and  acclamations  were  extreme  ;  and  on  a  Vote  of  Thanks  being  proposed  to  Mr.  W  A  LIIIII  A  N  it  was  several  k  minutes  before  the  acclamations  ceased.  We  will  make  few  observations  on  this  subject.  It  speaks  for  itself,  eloquently,  impressively  ;  and  comes  home  to  the  heart  of  every  Briton.  There  is  not  a  chord  in  the  breast  of  a  freeman,  which  does  not  vibrate,  in  har harmonious  monious harmonious  unison,  to  similar  sentiments.  They  are  the  native  language  of  a  community,  which,  for  a  century  and  a  half,  possessed  the  highest  advantages  of  practical  freedom.  How  we  glory  in  our  country,  where  similar  principles  arc  prevalent—where  similar  sentiments  may  be  expressed,  without  detriment  to  the  public  order,  without  flange;  to.  the  Speaker  !  This  is  the  practical  ditrerence  between  free  states  and  nations  writhing  under  the  lash  of  Despotism.  In  Petersburgh  or  Paris,  similar  proceedings  in  their  Town  Halls  would  be  the  signal  of  general  disorder  ;  the  immediate  precursors  of  the  overthrow  of  the  Govern►nent,  In  London,  they  consolidate  the  throne,  anii  establiof  on,  an  immutable  basis  the  public  security.  The  city  of  London,  in  every  great  and  national  concerti  formerly  played  a  pre-eminent  and  an  honourable  h;►rt.  Their  precut  proceedings  testify  that  the  ancient  spirit,  the  tOrmer  independence  preside  in  a  [fall,  where  BEc►:eunu  is  immortalised  for  the  zeal,  spirit,  and  patriotism  be  dis displayed  played displayed  there.  If  the  sl►irit  of  a  patriot  hovers  occasionally  round  the  edifices  where  a  monument  is  consecrated  to  his  virtues,  with  what  complacency  must  that  generous  citizen  have  viewed  this  new  refulgence  of  public  spirit  in  a  place.  where  his  own  was  so  conspicuous,  so  beneficial  !  Mr.  -WArrumAs  merits  the  thanks  of  his  country.  lie  is  a  disinterested,  intelligent,  and  zealous  citizen.  1,l  i  4  conduct  on  this,  and  on  most  other  occasions,_  is  worthy  of  the  highest  panegyric.  lie  proceeds  manfully  and  honestly  to  the  discharge  of  his  public  duties;  fearless  of  calumny,  unawed  by  the  frown  of  power,  and  regardless  of  the  cen censure  sure censure  of  folly.  Ills  fellow  citizens  cannot  reward  his  exer exertions  tions exertions  with  too  much  confidence  or  gratitude.  We  wish  it  were  in  our  power  to  use  the  same  language  on  the  conduct  of  the  present  LORD  MA  TOR  !

A  Spanish  schooner,  the  Constancia,  which  arrived  at  Falmouth  from  Gijon  reports,  that  the  Marquis  DE  HirSIANA  has  had  an  action  with  the  French,  and  taken  1500  pri prisoners.  soners. prisoners.  The  accounts  from  Asturias  are  still  more  favourable.  These  loyal  and  intrepid  Mountaineers,  into  whose  province  the  enemy  never  dared  to  penetrate,  have  organised  a  force  of  near  40,000  men,  with  which,  accordi►►g  to  the  last  accounts,  they  are  preparing  to  act  offensively  against  the  enemy  in  Callicia.

They  arc  going  to  re-appear  on  the  Continent  in  support  of  their  country's  reputation,  in  defence  of  in in'  ' in'  jured  humanity,  under  auspices  the  most  encouraging,  with  inducements  to  action  the  most  binding,  that  es  er  nerved  the  arm,  or  raised  the  confidence  of,  a  soldier.  Exclusive  of  national  injuries,  they  have  individual  wrongs  to  revenge;—the  base  calumnies  which  the  enemy  circu circulated  lated circulated  after  their  departure,  must  be  washed  away  with  the  blood  of  their  calumniators.  Their  prowess  is  now  known  to,  and  acknowledged  by,  foes  and  allies;  it  will  raise  the  courage  and  ardour  of  the  one,  as  it  will  panic  strike  the  former.  These  observations  are  as  little  the  ell'ect  of  enthusiasm  as  of  declamation  ;  their  justice  must  be  acknowledged  by  every  impartial  and  intelligent  observer  of  the  -  British  character.  The  people  of  the  United  Kingdom  are  supremely  qualified  for  war,  and  for  the  execution  of  enterprises  on  a  large  scale.  Our  late  reverses,  the  effects  of  inexperience  and  of  over  cautious  policy,  rather  than  a  deficiency  of  judgment,  have  had  the  advantage,  that  we  arc  now  acquainted  with  the  cause,  why  our  exertions,  as  a  military  state,  leave  been  so  ineffitclual  for  sonic!  years.  They  are  to  lie  traced  alone  to  want  of  confidence  and  promptitude,  and,  by  no  means  to  a  want  of  sufficient  resources.

The  nomination  of  Sir  A  RTUU  a  Wfr:LLESLEV  to  the  chief  command  of  a  force,  whose  operations  arc  so  important,  must  command  one  unanimous  sentiment  of  approbation.

The  last  twenty  years  have  been  peculiarly  marked  by  physical  and  moral  convulsions.  Whilst  earthquakes,  inundations,  and  volcanic  eruptions  betrayed  an  alarmibg  fermentation  in  the  interior  o  f STYLE=superscript  our STYLE=superscript  globe,  all  the  hinges  of  society  have  been  viwently  burst  by  conspiracies,  re rebellions,  bellions, rebellions,  and  the  worst  crimes  which  have  disgraced  the  worst  ages  of  our  world.  Where,  and  how,  they  will  end,  it  is  now  beyond  the  reach  of  'human  prudence,  or  fore foresight,  sight, foresight,  to  determine.  It  requires,  however,  only  a  super superficial  ficial superficial  spirit  of  observation  to  be  convinced,i  that  the  cala calamities  mities calamities  with  which  we  have  been  already  visited,  tremend tremendous  ous tremendous  as  they  have  been,  arc  only  a  prelude  to  others,  at  which  thought  itself  recoils.  Our  nature  abhors  a  constant  antici anticipation  pation anticipation  of  gloomy  events;  but  the  symptoms  we  have  noticed  '  and  which  assume  every  day  a  more  malignant  aspect,  prove  there  is  a  mass.  of  feverish  matter  in  society,  which  must  occasion  a  dreadful  and  unheard  of  crisis.  The  rev  elution,  which  has  taken  place  in  Sweden,  is,  in  whatever  light  we  regard  it,  one  of  the  most  da  n STYLE=superscript  g  erous, STYLE=superscript  criminal, STYLE=superscript  and STYLE=superscript  impo impolitic STYLE=superscript  litic impolitic  occurrences,  we  have  ever  read  or  heard  of.  It  is  as  silly  and  unretlecting  an  action,  as  to  put  a  sword  into  the  hands  of  a  Madman.  The  minds  of  the  lower  classes,  in  every  part  of  Europeare  already  too  much  dissatisfied  with  their  governments  and  institutions  t  .  betray  too  impatient  a  sense  of  every  kind  of  restraint,  manifest  too  thatmark  -  ed  a  jealousy  of  the  higher  and  privileged  or  ders STYLE=superscript  ;  one  or  two  more  examples  of  this  kind  are  only  necessary  to  make  them  feel,  that  the  supposed  hardships  of  their  condition  originate  in  the  injustice  of  their  governments.  Whenever  that  dreadfal  moment  arrives—whenever  so  fatal  a  sentiment  begins  to  take  rooted  possession  of  their  minds,  a,  scene  cif  an  archy  and  complicated  atrocities STYLE=superscript  will STYLE=superscript  ensue,  which  will  convert  society  itself,  into  a  great  slaugh slaughter-house.  ter-house. slaughter-house.

We  appeal  to  every  man  of  honour  and,  honesty,  had  he  been  placed  in  the  situation  of  GUSTAVUS,  if  he  would  not  have  pursued  the  same  line  of  po policy,  licy, policy,  which  that  Monarch  did.  In  condemning  him,  every  Englishman  Must  condemn  his  own  govern government,  ment, government,  and  ivakes  the  base  acknowledg  ment,  that  .  interest,  and  not  justice,  is  the  basis  of  his  morality.  .  The  KING  of  SWEDEN  detested  BONAPARTE;  and  where  is  the  honest  man,  who  does  not  detest  a  murderer  and  a  robber.  He  had  the  magnanimity  to  spurn  his  insidious  oilers  of  friendship  ;  and  every  man,  who  has  the  slightest  respect  for  himself,  or  feeling  for  others,  would  act  with  the  same  spirit  and  magnanimity.  He  tried  to  maintain  the  independence  of  his  country  against  an  unprovoked  attack;  he  appealed  to  the  loyalty  and  coura  g  e  of  his  sub subjects  jects subjects  to  assist  him  in  so  sacred  and  lionouraLle  a  cause  ;  .  and  if  he  has  fallen  in  it,  he  carries  with  him  the  consolation,  that  the  honest  and  impartial  of  every  country  admire  his  principles,  and  take  a  warm  interest  in  his  fate.  It  may  be  asked  how  far  a  government  has  a  right  to  in.  terfere  in  the  conduct  of  another  country..  But  if  an  inter interference  ference interference  of  that  kind  be  justifiable,  ours  has  a  strong  interest  to  employ  every  means  in  its  power,  to  re-establish  the  deposed  Sovereign.  Conciliatory  measures  may  have  a  good  effect  on  some  occasions;  but  we  believe,  that  only  vigorous  and  decisive  policy  can  bring  back  the  Swedish  nation  to  a  sense  of  the  atrocity  committed  against  their  SOVEREIGN.  For  Heaven's  sake  !  let  us  at  least  avoid  giving  a  sanction  to  usurpation,  by  allowing  a  British  Minister  to  remain  at  a  court,  where  the  Sovereign  lan.  :  guishes  in  chains,  in  consequence  If  his  friendship  to  this  country.  Positive  instructions,  we  trust,  will  be  immediT  ately  transmitted  to  Mr.  Mcnav  to  make  a  peremptory  declaration,  that  unless  GUSTAVUS  be  immediately  re-esta re-established,  blished, re-established,  the  British  Government  is  determined  to  take  the  most  effectual.and  vigorous  means  to  effect  it.  The  revolution  has  been  effected  without  the  least  blood bloodshed,  shed, bloodshed,  and  without  theislightest  resistance,  on  the  part  of  the  people  of  Stockholm.  The  inhabitants  of  the  capital  in  al almost  most almost  every  country,  are  morally  and  politically  more  de depraved  praved depraved  than  such  as  inhabit  the  provinces.  Bodily  vigour,  love  of  country,  and  simplicity  of  mind,  are  frequently  found  at  the  greatest  distance  from  the  seat  of  power.  Whether  this  be  the  fault  of  courts  or  ministers;  or  if  it  be  a  consequence  of  the  dissipation  and  egotism  which  predominate  in  large  towns,  —we  will  not  take  upon  us  to  decide.  But  that  the  fact  is  se,  has  been  proved  by  recent  occur  rences  in  several  countries  ;  a  nd STYLE=superscript  Sweden STYLE=superscript  has STYLE=superscript  furnished  us  with  a  new  example  in  support  of  this  opinion.----Whilst  the  people  of  Stockholm  tamely  and  basely  beheld  the  de_  rsition  of  their  Sovereign,  the  hardy  inhabitants  of  Dale.  carlia  have  formally  protested  against  the  infamous  act.

The  communication  of  a  single  fact,  obnoxious  to  the  views  of  the  tyrant,  would  be  succeeded  by  the  imme immediate  diate immediate  seizure  of  the  property  and  person  of  the  imprudent  publisher;  and  his  life  pay  the  penalty  of  his  indiscretion.  Inder  such  restrictions,  there  is  no  possibility  of  obtaining  in  this  country,  certain  intelligence  from  Germany.  What  we  receive  is  purely  French.  From  that  source  every  thing,  ns  may  be  expected,  magnifies  the  armies  and  finances  of  the  enemy,  as  much  as  it  endeavours  to  depreciate  those  of  Austria.

A  letter  from  Lisbon,  by  the  last  packet,  discloses  a  fact  of  great  interest.  A  French  spy  was  discovered,  and  his  person  and  papers  secured  a  few  hours  after  he  had  left  Lisbon.  He  had  previously  imposed  himself  on  the  Mem Members  bers Members  of  the  Regency,  as  a  secret,  but  accredited  agent  from  the  Court  of  London,  and  in  that  character  obtained  from  time  to  time  the  whole  of  the  plans  for  the  future  move movements  ments movements  and  disposal  of  the  British,  as  well  as  the  Portu Portuguese  guese Portuguese  troops.

This  concealment,  so  eagerly  solicited,  excite.l  suspicion  and  led  to  entriries,  the  result  of  which  was  an  tatter  from  the  Regcncy  to  secure  his  person.  He  had,  how.

This  Report  contains  a  voluminous  detail,  of  which  we  con conceive  ceive conceive  that  a  brief  abstract  will  be  sufficient  for  the  general  Reader.  A  number  of  abuses  have  been  brought  to  light  ;  but  it  is  satisfactory  to  know  that  there  appears  no  proof  whatever  either  of  corruption  or  connivance  on  the  part  of  any  one  of  the  Directors,  A  remedy  has  been  proposed  by  the  Committee  as  a  check  on  the  purchase  of  such  appointments,  namely,  That  a  bond  shall  be  given  by  the  parent,  guardian,  or  friend  of  every  person  receiving  a  nomination,  containing  a  penalty  to  be  paid  on  any  future  proof  that  a  valuable  consideration  was  given  for  such  This  retrospective  provision  appears,  how however,  ever, however,  to  demand  a  strict  inquiry,  and  a  very  serious  discussion.  The  following  are  some  of  the  instances  of  abuse  quoted  by  the  Committee,  from  which  it  appears,  that  the  patronage  of  the  Directors  was  perverted  to  improper  uses  by  inferior  agents  :  221  CADETSUIPS.  The  sales  of  those  nppointmems  were  extremely  numeron4.  They  were  sold  at  from  150  to  300  guineas.  The  general  agent  in  this  branch  of  the  business  was  Mr.  Anticslev  Shee,  who  was  represented  by  Mr,  Bankes,  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  as  having  grossly  prevaricated.  A  great  number  of  other  names  are  mentioned,  which  it  is  not  necessarsy  to  lay  before  the  public.  as  they  merely  neguciated  an  exchange  from  Bengal  to  Madrai,  and  vice  versa,  Here  follows  a  detailed  account  of  the  measures  employed  by  the  Company  for  the  prevention  of  those►  ;ambles,  We  shall  not  enter  into  the  history  of  precautions,  which  experience  ltati  proved  to  be  toetfectual.

STYLE=superscript  evading  all  restrictions,  which  stand  in  the  way  of  present  Gentlemen,  this  is  a  try  ing  crisis.  We  live  in  an  age  of  in inquisition,  quisition, inquisition,  which,  unless  followed  up  by  reformation,  will  termi terminate  nate terminate  in  revolution.  The  princes  of  Leadenhall  7  street,  as  well  as  greater  princes  than  they,  must  submit  to  senatorial  investi investigation,  gation, investigation,  and  defer  to  the  dictates  of  popular  Opinion.  Your  dynasty,  Gentlemen,  is  not  quite  ancient'enoughlo  sanctify  its  abuses.  Though  you  have  subdued  the  great  continent  of  Asia,  you  must  not  expect  to  deceive  the  most  enlightened  people  in  Europe.  One  thing  rather  gratifies  me.  lam  Pleased  to  ob observe,  serve, observe,  if  such  a  discovery  can  at  all  please,  that  corruption  journies  eastward  as  well  as  westward  ;  and  that  the  good  men  of  Leaden4lall  may  finally  shake  hands  With  the  great  men  of  St.  James's.

WESTMINSTER  MEETING.  At  12  o'clock  on  Wednesday  a  vast  concourse  began  to  assem-.  ble  in  Westminster  Hall,  in  consequence  of  the  notice  given  by  advertisement  for  the  inhabitant-householders  of  1S  estininsier  to  meet  to  consider  of  the  recent  investigation  into  the  conduct  of  the  late  Commander  in  Chief.

The  requisition  for  convening  the  Meeting  having  been  read  from  the  ('hair,  Mr.  Swell  said  it  was  impossible  for  the  inhabitants  of  West Westminster  minster Westminster  not  to  come  forward  on  such  an  occasion.  The  eves  of  the  whole  kingdom  were  upon  them.  Their  local  situation  gave  them  an  opportunity,  beyond  others,  of  knowing,  that  the  abuses  which  Mr.  Wardle  had  so  successfully  exposed  had  existed  for  a  series  of  years;  and  knowing  as  they  did  that  such  abuses  pre prevailed,  vailed, prevailed,  they  could  not  b  s  yt  feel  additional  gratitude  to  that  Gen Gentleman  tleman Gentleman  who  had  now  laid  them  open  to  the  indignation  of  the  vOmle  united  empire  —Owl  applause).

Had  the  'louse  of  Commons.  been  composed  of  a  representation  of  the  people,  he  was  persuaded  that  Mr.  Wardle,  so  far  from  being  left  in  a  minority,  would  have  carried  his  motion  unanimously.  After  paying  some  high  compliments  to  Mr.  Samuel  Whitbread,  fiir  Francis  Illo.dett,  Lord  Folkestone,  Sir  Samuel  Romilly,  Mr.  Cony  en,  Sir  Thomas  Torton,  General  Ferguson,  and  the  other  Gentlemen  who  had  supported  Mr.  Wardle  in  the  course  of  the  Invest  lotion,  he  caoctuded  with  moving  a  series  of  Resolutions.

That  the  inhabitants  of  this  city,  from  the  means  of  infor information  mation information  which  their  local  situation  affords  them,  have  long  been  aware  of  the  existence  of  scandalous  and  corrupt  practices  various  departments  of  the  state,  and  by  the.  late  investigation  in  the  Honourable  the  House  of  Commons,  the  fact  has  been  made  manifest  to  !very  part  c,f  the  United  K  ingdom.

He  was  per persuaded,  suaded, persuaded,  that  had  the  case  of  the  Duke  of  York  been  submitted  to  any,  jury  of  twelve  men,  it  was  impossibte  but  that  they  must  have  found  him  guilty  of  the  charges  brought  against  hint.  Sir  FRANCIS  BURDETT  declared,  that  tile  late  occasion  had  shcwn  More  than  ever  the  necessity  of  a  Parliamentary  Reform.  The  people  intt  of  doors  were  gnat:boons  in  condemning  the  Duke  of  York,  while  a  majority  in  the  House  of  Commons  thought  proper  to  acquit  him.  Had  the  II  ou4  of  Commons  been  chosen  fairly  and  freely,  • STYLE=superscript  as  by  the  Constitution  it  ought  to  be,  there  could  he  no  doubt  but  that  the  decision  or  the  House  of  Commons  Would  have  assimilated  with  the  feeliogs  of  the  peo people  ple people  out  of  doors.  With  if  egard  to  the  Bill  brought  in  by  the  Vll'lllo'llor  of  the  Exchequer,  for  preventing  atinses  in  tbe  futore  disposal  of  otiiees,  he  could  ant  help  considering  it  as  a  gross  delosion  On  the  public.  It  was  an  attack  n  - STYLE=superscript  .  1  the  minor  agents  of  corruption,  while  it  left  the  principals  untouched.  (Loud  applattNe.)  The  Honourable  Baronet  compared  the  situation  of  the  country  to  that  of  Prometheus,  as  fa].]od  by  the  poets,  w  hose  liver  was  supposed  to  he  renewed  as  fast  as  it  vvas  devoured  by  a  vulture.  The  industry  et'  the  country  was  de devoured  voured devoured  by  the  vulture  of  corruption.  (Laud  applause.)  Stone  had  been  led  away  with  an  idea  that  the  sub:eet  was  one  of  par part  t part  ieular  ez.licacy,  because  the  favourite  son  nf  the  King  was  the  person  accused  ;  but  he  could  not  see  tint  it  was  a  subject  on  which  any  . STYLE=superscript  delicacy  ought  to  he  shewn.  One  particular  feature  of  the  busiors  he  could  mit  help  noticing,  and  that  was,  the  anxiety  which  ninny  Members  of  tie  House  of  Cornmhos  had  shewn  to  ,diselnim  all  partiripat  lot)  of  feeling  with  the  people  out  of  doors  a  poll  tine  occasion;  and  it  so  happened,  that  lie  House  of  Comtaotts  wits  perhaps  the  only  sp:)i  in  Europe  where  the  fedi:4;s  bait:  Antimeuts  of  the  people  of  Logland  were.  pru-  243  fessedly  disregarded.  Was  this  decent  with  revird  to  the  peo people  ple people  of  England  ?  Could  this  possibly  happen  if  the  House  of  Commons  were  constituted  as  it  ought  to  be  ?  The  lion.  Hato-  net  considered  the  Committees  of  inquiry,  and  Committees  ap appointed  pointed appointed  to  examine  into  Abuses,  as  mere  delusions,  which.eould  be  attended  with  no  good  effects  whatever.  The  House  of  Com.  mans  was  unsound,  and  as  long  as  it  continued  so,  they  could  hope  for  no  radical  reform  of  abuse.  (Loud  applause).  It  was  not  to  new  laws  that  they  had  occasion  to  have  recourse  for  the  correction  of  abuses  ;  they  had  only  to  require  the  execu execution  tion execution  of  toe  oltl  eoh  , STYLE=superscript  titutional  laws  of  the  realm—Magna  Charta  and  the  Bill  of  Rights.  Ile  next  adverted  to  the  severe  sentences  which  had  of  late  years  been  passed  in  that  Hall  (the  sentences  of  Messrs.  White  and  Hart);  and  contended  that  they  would  never  have  been  tolerated,  had  the  House  of  Commons  been  the  true  representative  body  of  the  people.  The  Hon.  Baronet  con.  eluded  with  recommending  Parliamentary  Reform  as  the  only  clurse  to  be  adopted  whic!l  could,  in  the  present  state  of  the  world,  preserve  the  country  from  foreign  subjugation.  It  was  a  matter  of  indifference  to  him  who  were  Ministers,  because  he  (lid  not  see  that  any  one  class  of  men  pursued  the  public  good  more  than  another  when  they  got  into  place;  and  therefore  he  was  convinced  that  nothing  but  Parliamentary  Reforin  could  save  the  nation.  _  _  Mr.  W11111311E49  thanked  the  Meeting  for  the  honour  they  had  done  him  in  mentioning  his  name  o  frequently  in  their  Re Resolutions;  solutions; Resolutions;  but  he  could  not  help  saying,  that  he  had  .done  no  more  than  Lis  duty  (Loud  applause.);  and  therefore  he  saw  no  reasorf  why  he  ought  to  be  thanked.  1t  was  undoubtedly  grati gratifying  fying gratifying  to  him,  tart  on  this  occasion  he  hacl  .riven  his  vote  in  con conformity  formity conformity  with  the  popular  sentiment  ;  but  had  '- STYLE=superscript  it  been  otherwise,  the  evidence  was  so  strong  and  :,o  fully  substantiated,  that  he  shoula  have  voted  as  he  did,  and  as  in  his  conscience  he  felt  he  was  bound  to  do.  (Loud  applause).  iie  concurred  with  the  lion.  Baronet  in  the  necessity  of  a  Parliamentary  Reform,  a  measure  which  he  had  always  advocated;  and  said,  that  he  had  no  dont);  but  that  it  might  he  effected  by  the  temperate  and  un unanimous  animous unanimous  exertions  of  the  people..  The  recent  example  of  the  resignation  of  the  Commander  in  Chief  was  a  striking  proof  of  what  the  people  could  do.  Ile  had  indeed  been  acquitted  by  a  majority  of  the  House  of  Commons;  but  the  voice  of  the  public  was  so  strongly  against  him,  that  it  was  impossible  for  him  to  retain  hi:,  situation.  In  the  same  way,  if  the  people  wished  for  a  Reform  in  Parliament,  and  were  equally  unani unanimous,  mous, unanimous,  he  had  no  doubt  but  a  Reform  in  Parliament  would  follow  in  six  months.  But  if  the  people  suffered  themselves  11  be  turned  aside  by  any  silly  delusion,  as  that  of  Jacobin Jacobinism,  ism, Jacobinism,  of  which  he  and  many  of  his  friends  had  formerly  been  accused,  or  the  more  recent  delusion  of  No  which  brought  the  present  Ministers  into  power,  their  enemies  would  always  lay  hold  of  such  pretexts  to  rei'use  Parliamentary  Re  form,  and,  as  long  as  the  people  continued  divided,  it  was  im-  The  Resolutions  were  then  put  and  carried  unanimously.  pos  .

Baronet,  that  it  was  a  matter  of  indifference  who  were  Ministers,  because  the  former  Ministers  had  shewn  that  they  would  not  remain  in  office  merely  for  the  sake  of  re receiving  ceiving receiving  their  'salaries;  and  he  thought  the  people  had  acted  unfairly  by  their  - STYLE=superscript  friends  in  suffering  them-elves  to  be  led  away  by  the  cry  of  as  they  had  been.  Parlia Parliamentary  mentary Parliamentary  Reform  could  only  be  accomplished  by  the  firm  and  temperate  eNpression  of  the  will  of  the  people;  and  when whenever  ever whenever  the  people  became  unanimous  in  its  favour,  there  was  no  doubt  but  it  must  be  carried.  Mr.  Whitbread  concluded  with  returning;  thanks  to  the  Meeting  for  their  patient  hearing,  and  was  cheered  with  loud  and  repeated  huzzas.  It  was  also  unanimously  resolved,  that  the  Thanks  of  this  Meeting  he  given  to  Arthur  Morris,  Esq.  the  High  Bailiff,  for  the  promptness  with  which  lie  called  this  Meeting,  and  for  his  impartial  conduct  in  the  Chair.

It  was  brought  up  to  London,  as  we  understand,  by  the  order  of  the  Lord  Mayor,  under  the  direction  of  the  Water  Bailiff;  and  the  contrivance  for  its  conveyance  was  rather  curious.  The  barge  on  board  of  which  it  now  is,  was  brought  along-side  the  fish  at  high-water,  scuttled  and  sunk  ;  the  next  title  of  flood  the  fish  was  towed  to  a  position  directly  over  the  barge,  and  gradually  sunk  into  her,  as  the  title  ebbed.  The  barge  , STYLE=superscript  ting  on  shore  at  low  water,  was  of  course  soon  drained  through  hr.r  scuttle  holes,  and  the  plugs  be being  ing being  then  replaced,  she  floated  v.  ith  her  unwieldy  cargo  the  next  tide,  and  was  twought  up  to  her  preseut  moorings  on  Wednesday  Afternoon.  The  appearance  of  whales  in  the  Thames,  though  rare,  is  by  tin  means  umistial.  Grainpn=es,  indeed,  have  been  often  teen  so  high  as  Black  wall,  and  even  Lowlon  Bridge.  In  the  memory  of  many  per-on-  resiEng  near  the  fo,-mer  place,  four  have  been  seen  there  at  one  time,  sporting  am:  spontinz  up  the  water  to  a  considerable  height  and  in  the  year  1780,  a  whale  of  90  feet  in  length  was  killed  near  the  same  place  as  that  now  exhibiting.

Enmity  to  France  might  he  made  by  skilful  ministers  the  great  focus  to  attract  the  popular  sentiment.  The  R  mans  and  Greeks,  whose  policy  we  edmire  the  more  we  stapdy  it,  as  soon  as  a  dangerous  spirit  of  discontent  began  to  manifest  i  self  among  the  people,  hastened  to  divert  it  by  war,  and  judi judifl  fl judifl STYLE=superscript  ciously  c  mverted  that  very  feeling,  which  would  have  been  so  highly  injurious  to  the  coat  nullity,  to  advance  its  honour  and  security.
