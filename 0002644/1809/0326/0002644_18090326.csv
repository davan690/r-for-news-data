The  terror  and  general  sympathy,  which  the  novelty  of  the  danger  had  created,  have  already  began  to  abate  sensibly  ;  and  governments  and  states  acknowledge  the  empire  of  custom.

No  serious  measures  bave  been  proposed,  not  even  the  will  is  manifested,  on  our  part,  to  avert  from  our  neighbours  the  calamity,  which,  after  it  has  overspread  their  lands,  will  rage,  with  tenfold  violence,  against  our  own  fences.  We  perceive  the  danger  of  their  situation,  and  may  easily  anti anticipate  cipate anticipate  our  own  ;  their  imploring  cries  are  heard;  their  hands,  invoking  as,istarice  s  are  stretched  out  to  us;  but  neither  sympa sympathy  thy sympathy  in  their  distress,  nor  the  roar  of  the  approaching  torrent,  can  render  us  more  alert,  or  produce  a  corresponding  measure  of  vigilance  and  action.

The  rich  and  the  poor,  the  nobleman  and  the  mechanic,  have  now  their  midnight  orgies,  and  resort  to  means  equally  iniquitous  in  order  to  support  them  —the  one  defrauds  his  creditor,  and  the  other  his  employer;  whilst  both  display  more  alarming  indifference  to  their  social  obligations.  Thus  the  heartless  debauchery  of  the  castle,and  the  wild  riot  of  the  cellar,  equally  contribute  to  corrupt  the  moral  and  physical  stamina  of  the  community;  and  our  feelings  arc  blunted,  our  strength  too  much  dissipated,  to  be  able  to  display  energy,  resentment,  or  enthusiasm,  sufficient  to  surmount  the  dif difficulties,  ficulties, difficulties,  or  punish  the  atrocities  of  the  pre4ent  age.  These  disheartening  reflections  rush  upon  our  minds  with  a  painful  conviction,  whenever  we  take  a  survey  of  our  national  concerns  and  pursuits.  On  the  part  of  the  public,  a  chilling  apathy  is  visible;  on  that  of  Ministers,  weakness,  and  irresolution.  The  inch:-  knee  and  improvidence  of  the  latter  are  as  repulsive,  as  the  inditference  of  the  former  is  alarming.

No  preparations  are  made  by  Government,  no  strong  inter..st  is  displayed  by  the  public  ;  and  we  shew  the  same  remissness  though  infinitely  less  enthusiasm,  than  we  did  in  the  case  of  Spanish  resistance.  Our  negligence  and  inaction  blasted  every  hope  which  that  propitious  occurrence  hatl  justified  ;  and  we  now  purine  the  same  conduct,  after  experience  has  snewn  its  disgraceful  and  ruinous  tendency.

Acting  as  the  allies,  not  the  masters  of  Spain,  it  was  impossible,  after  such  an  answer,  that  any  violent  measure  should  be  taken  to  enforce  what  was  thought  by  the  Spaniards  contrary  to  the  interests  of  their  coun country.  try. country.

The  reason  why  his  Royal  Highness  had  not  before  made  an  offer  of  resignation  was,  that  the  House  should  first  decide  upon  the  great  question  of  his  guilt  or  innocence  in  respect  to  the  al alleged  leged alleged  charge  of  corruption  or  criminal  connivance.  While  that  charge  remained  undecided,  if  his  Royal  Highness  had  resigned  his  situation,  it  would  have  seemed  as  if  he  had  done  so  to  avert  any  further  proceedings  against  him,  and  therefore  his  Royal  Highness  chose  rather  to  delay  his  resignation  till  the  House  had  come  to  a  decision  on  that  point,  than  leave  his  character  ex-.  posed  to  the  suspicion  of  having  done  any  thing  through  a  dread  or  apprehension  of  what  might  be  the  decision  of  the  House  on  a  question  so  material  to  his  character  and  honour.

At  present,  indeed  there  was  no  actual  want  of  it,  but  he  ti;ought  it  prudent  for  the  country  to  guard  against  all  possible  accidents;  for  _although  America  might  net  at  present  he  deemed  hostile  to  this  country,  there  was  ao  pos possibility  sibility possibility  of  deterniinin.g•  whether  she  might  not  become  so,  and  it  became  us  to  guard  against  all  pos:sible  contingents.  If  that  were  the  cape,  how  ever,  still  the  growers  of  flax  in  Ireland  ~ould  not  be  expected  to  forego  t!teir  own  interests  in  permitting  their  tiax  to  attain  the  proper  state  of  maturity,  when  it  could  yield  recd  fit  for  heitig  sown  11;,E.  succeeding  year,  unless  some  reward  was  held  out  to  then  sufficient  to  counterbalance  their  private  interest.  because  they  had  so  many  temptations  to  cut  it  at  an  earlier  period.  Mr.  PA  B.N  ELL  said  th;-  measure  was  liable  to  all  the  objec objections  tions objections  which  applied  ti;  bounties  in  general.  It  was  false  policy  to  eneoura  t  T,i;  ittly  article  by  bounties,  or  any  other  reward.  —  The  proper  way  to  encourage  them,  was  to  leave  them  entirely  p  IbrinEelve3,  and  permit  the  capitalists  to  employ  their  stock  in  any  manner  they  should  think  proper.  Mr.  Ga  ATTA  N  supported  the  Bill.

MARCH  Q.  given,  and  'professed  his  profound  respect  and  submission  to  whatever  might  be  the  decision  of  the  House.  If  it  was  the,  pleasure  of  the  House,  the  Speaker  added,  he  would  read  the  letter.  Sir  M.  W.  Rim.  Est  spoke  shortly  in  extenuation  of  the  eon.  duct  of  General  Clavering.  That  Gentleman  allowed  that  hid  evidence  was  chargeable  with  contradiction,  hut  it  had  arisen  from  a  misconception  of  the  questions  that  Tie  put  to  him,  anti  not  from  any  wish  to  deceive  the  House.  begged  the  House  to  recollect,  that  even  the  Honourable  Member  who  brought  forward  the  charges  agaipst  the  Oldie  of  York,  had  been  obliged  to  explain  his  testimony,  and  had'forgotteh  when  he  had  seen  Mrs.  Clarke,  though  ho  had  semi  her  only  twenty-four  hours  be.  fore.  Mr.  MiNAueatTrN  thought  that  the  appeal  which  had  been  made  to  the  rank  and  education  of  General  Clavering,  t  for  nothing  at  all  ;  and  in  fact  rather  bore  against  hint,  as  something  very  difierent  was  to  he  expected  froin  him,  and  prevarication  ought  to  be  more  severely  visit.d  upon  such  •a  man  lima  upon  one  of  inferior  rank  in  'life.  Ile  w:s  . STYLE=superscript  .S  personally  unacquainted  with  Genmil•  Cla'erin  g  ;  but  he  believed,  if  his  Constituents  (Antrim)  were  asked  a  bout  blip,  they  could  say  something  of  hira.  Mrs.  Clarke,  so  far  as  she  could,  had  been  a  benefactress  to  the  GenerAl  i  and  coming  to  undermine  her  evil  dence,  he  had  wilfully  contradicted  himself.  What  would  the  public  say,  if  they  saw  Sandon  hurried  from  that  Baeto  Nevv.  gate,  and  General  Clavering  permitted  to  gounPunished  for  the  same  ()fence  ?  Mr.  WIIITUREAD  professed  lie  felt  considerable  surprize  at  hearin;  the  Honourable  Baronet  . STYLE=superscript  Make  'an  uncalled  for  attack  on  his  Hon.  Friend  (Mr.  Wardle),  who  had  come  forward  in  the  course  of  the  examination  to  explain  a  slight  mis.  take  which  he  had  fallen  into  from  want  of  recollection.  •  But  there  was  thi3  material  distinction  •  between  the  two  cases,  that  his  lion.  Friend  had  no  motive  'whatever  for  concealment.,  and  immediately  rectified  the  mistake;  while  Gen.  (layering  had  motive,  for  he  professedly  came  forward  to  overturn  and  con  •  found  the  evidence  of  the  principal  witness.  If  the  lion.  Baro Baronet  net Baronet  had  any  charge  against  the  evidence  of  his  Hon.  Friend,  he  called  upon  him  to  make  it  manfully.  If  the  letters  of  Gene Generat  rat Generat  Clavering  to  Mrs.  Clarke  bad  never  appeared,  his  testimony  would  have  gone  a  great  way  to  overturn  lter  evidence;  and  yet  it  was  to  be  observed,  that  General  Clavering  never  came  for  4  ward  to  correct  his  testimony  till  after  these  letters  appeared,  and  then  he  felt  it  nece3sary  to  oTer  an  exp  lanation,  which  in.  volved  him  farther.  The  Honoura  bt  Baronet  seemed  to  think  that  the  country  at  last  would  do  justrte  to  the  honour  of  General  Claverin  ;  on  the  contrary,  he  believed  that  as  long  as  people  were  able  to  read  his  evidence,  they  would  come  to  the  same  decision  Which  he  trusted  the  House  would'tome  to  that  night.  As  to  General  clavering's  family  and  connections,  he  certainly  must  feel  for  their  y  ery  painful  siteation.  But  had  not  Capt.  sandon  also  a  wife,  a  family,  and  connections?  If  Gem  Clavering  is  excused,  who  knows  but  such  an  example  of  im impunity  punity impunity  may  cost  at  a  future  timesome  one  his  life?  If  the  Ifouse  did  not  deal  out  impartial  justice  in  thiS  case,  it  would  give  at:-  ditional  currency  to  a.  disticb  which  was  too  of(  in  the  mouths  of  the  lower  orders  _  rich  men  were,  like  us,  to  swing,  It  would  make  land  cheaper,  so  many  would  Mr.  PERCI  VA  L.  for  his  part,  could  not  s?e  from  what  part  of  the  evidence  General  Clavering  could  be  :Wall  defended.  ,He  came  to  that  Bar,  tuisrepresentingthat.  which  led  him  there,  as  if  it  was  entirely  of  his  own  motive  and  desire,  •and  never  inti.  mated  that  he  had  had  the  least  communication  with  any  other  person  on  tht►  subject  ;  and  yet  when  to  caine  to  explain,  he  told  the4iouse,  that  he  was  not  a  voluntary  -  witness,  but  ha  4  been  brought  forward  by  Al  r.

On  the  eventual  conduct,  or  the  pre present  sent present  policy  of  Russia,  it  is  more  difficult  to  decide  ;  but  even  the  testimony  of  the  enemy  corroborates  the  important  fact,—that  she  will  not  act  agerst  .Austria.  However,  if  our  Readers  are  to  allow  a  single  particle  of  goad  sense,  honour,  or  integrity,  to  exist  in  the  councils  of  that  court,  or  that  a  spark  of  PiTea's  genius  and  of  CATIIERINE'S  ambition,  lurks  in  the  remotest  fold  of  ALEx.s.ora's  heart,  they  must  be  convinced  that  she  will  act  for  Austria.  We  have,  however,  some  facts  which  may  guide  our  speculations  in  this  respect;—  the  recall  of  ROM.  NZOFF  from  Paris,  the  chang  e  in  the  foreign  department,  the  n  egoc  iatio  n  w  ith  'Tu  rkey,  the  journey  of  their  Prussian  Majesties  to  St..  Petersburg,  and  the  measures  bordering  on  actual  hostility  to  France  carried  into  execution  on  their  return  ;  these  are  facts,  which  ?  at  any  other  period,  would  be  considered  as  unequivocal  proofs  of  a  total  change  in  the  policy  of  that  Court.  We  must  acknowledge,  we  are  among  the  number  of  those  who  anticipatr..,  that  event;  and,  when  we  look  back  the  short  space  of  two  years,  when  ALEXANDER  dis disflayed  flayed disflayed  so  much  loyalty,  good  faith,  an  d  magnan  i  m  ity,  we  ondly  and  pertinaciously  adhere  to  the  hope,  that  a  Mo Monarch,  narch, Monarch,  who  stood  once,  and  so  deservedly,  high  in  the  esteem  of  this  country,  will  soon  rank  again  among  the  zpost  ardent  of  our  supporters  in  favour  o  f  universalfree universalfreedom.  dom. universalfreedom.  Dent  ark  follows  of  course  in  the  vortex  of  Russian  politics.  These  appearances,  so  corresponding  with  the  wishes  and  interests  of  'every  man,  who  knows  to  appreciate  the  bles blessings  sings blessings  of  freedom,  and  to  whom  oppression  and  lawless  ra rapine  pine rapine  are  subjects  of  abhorrence,  become  more  cheering,  when  united  with  the  new  spirit  of  liberty  and  resistance,  which  has  dnce  more  displayed  itself,  with  so  much  vigour,  in  every  part  of  Spain.  The  iron  crown  may  he  still  shat shatterred  terred shatterred  on  Ole  head  of  the  tyrant  himself;  and  a  fair  morn morning  ing morning  may  succeed  the  long  and  dismal  night  of  disorder.  We  can  never  abandon  this  idea,  as  long  as  a  ray  of  hope  shoots  across  the  political  horizon.  It  may  be  more  con-  Sistent  with  the  temper  and  principles  of  some  writers,  to  discover  only  motives  of  terror  and  despondency,  where  we  find  a  source  of  consolation  ;  but  however  they  may  exult  iu  the  conscious  pride  of  superior  sense  and  penetra penetration,  tion, penetration,  we  would  not  abandon  our  good  opinion  of  mankind  for  their  good  opinion  of  themselves,  All  the  Weekly  Papers,  almost  without  exception,  seem  to  have  laid  it  down  ai  an  invariable  rule  in  their  speculations,  to  present  their  Readers  only  with  the  gloomy  side  of  the  question;  and  influenced,  we  would  hope,  rather  by  custom,  than  by  principle,  evince  no  small  degree  of  exultation  when  their  gloomy  anticipations  have  been  realized  by  occurrences.  This  conduct,  from  whatever  cause  it  may  proceed,  is  in infinitely  finitely infinitely  dangerous  and  reprehensible;  and,  Were  it  univer universally  sally universally  adopted,  considering  the  great  influence  which  Jour Journia;ts  nia;ts Journia;ts  have  over  the  pnblic  opinion,  it  would  leave  no  tither  alternative,  than  to  renounce  freedom  of  discussion,  or  to  contemplate,  with  moral  certainty,  the  arrival  of  a  period,  When  Cuglish  men  would  evince  as  much  indifference  as  they  display  ardour  at  preseet,  for  the  interests  or  ho honour  nour honour  of  their  country.  This  evil  habit  has  so  much  vitiated  their  British  feelings,  and  even  those  which  are  common  to  every  man  of  education,  that  they  cannot  guard  the  com common  mon common  forms  of  politeness,  whenever  they  advert  to  the  lead leadin;  in; leadin;  then  in  those  countries  which  are  most  closely  united  to  otirs  by  the  ties  of  friendship  and  reciprocal  interests.  There  is  as  much  folly  as  brutality  in  such  unwarrantable  strictures;  and  if  they  have  no  respect  for  tho  character  or  welfare  of  their  country,  which  must  suffer  from  their  insolence,  they  should,  at  least,  have  some  respect  for  themselves,  by  observiag  the  us  ual  laws  of  deco decoruin.  ruin. decoruin.  MARGIT  26.  We  feel  the  highest  degree  of  exultation  in  being  able  to  confirm  the  accounts,  previously  received,  of  an  universal  spirit  of  resistance  having  once  more  manifested  itselfin  the  Northern  Provinces  of  Spain.  The  brave  peasants-  of  Gallicia,  Leon,  and  Asturias,  so  often  calumniated,-  we•  blush  to  say,  even  in  this  country,  have  risen  again  on  their  oppressors,  and  harrass  and  destroy  them  by  constant  and  irregular  attacks.  We  are  positively  informed  that  the  French  force  in  Gallicia  does  not  amount  to  20,000  men,  and  these  appear  to  be  worn  out  by.  incessant.  toil,  hunger,  and  disease.  The  patriotic  inhabitants  of  those  provinces  have  resumed,  as  we  predicted  two  months  ago,  the  enthu enthusiasm  siasm enthusiasm  and  courage  which  marked  so  prominently  -their  first  efforts.  The  rigour  of  the  winter  drove  these  poor  people,  destitute  as  they  were  of  the  simplest  necessaries  of  life,  and  the  most  essential  articles  of  clothing,  back  to  their  homes  ;  and  the  present  horrors  of  hunger  and  cold  outweighed,  as  might  be  expected,  the  remoter  terror  of  slavery.  The  invigorating  and  cheering  rays  of  a,  southern  sun  have  restored  them  to  life,  vigour  and  a  keen  sense  of  their  injuries.  They  can  now  dispense  with  the  use  of  hats  and  shoes,  they  can  carry  in  their  knap knapsacks  sacks knapsacks  the  week's  sustenance  ;  and  emboldened  by  partial  success,  and  taught  the  advantages  of  an  irregular  mode  of  warfare,  they  will  become  more  formidable  than  ever  to  their  infamous  invaders.  This  pleasing  intelligence  is  corrobated  by  the  arrival  of  the  Busy  cutter,  which  loft  Lisbon  on  the  26th  ai  Febru February.  ary. February.  We  learn  from  this  source,  that  the  French  have  abandoned  the  Portuguese  frontiers,  and  that  the  levies  of  that  kingdom,  uniting  with  the  remains  of  the  Spanish  army,  have  put  themselves  under  the  command  of  the  Patriotic  ROMANA,  who  was  preparing,  at  the  head  of  25,000  men,  to  aid  the  efforts  of  the  brave  peasants.  Lord  COCRRA  NE  arrived  at  Plymouth  on  Monday  in  tha  Impericuse  from  Gibraltar  and  Cadiz.  He  has  brought  in.  telligence  from  Spain  of  a  pleasing  complexion.  The  let.,  ters  from  Gibraltar  are  of  the  28th  ult.  The  most  interest interesting  ing interesting  fact  at  present  known,  though  somewhat  confusedly,  is,  that  at  Cadiz  serious  tumults  have  arisen,  from  a  sus  •  picion  on  the  part  of  the  people,  too  well  justified  by  fatal  experience  in  other  quarters,  that  their  magistrates  were  unfaithful  to  the  cause  of  their  country.  The  immediate  occasion  is  understood  to  be  the  following  Some  of  the  French  prisoners,  who,  under  that  de•  scription,  had  been  so  long  confined  at  Cadiz,  made  the  suspicious  otter  of  their  services  to  garrison  the  town,  and  to  make  this  proposal  palatable,  declared  themselves  to  be  Poles,  and  not  Frenchmen.  The  Marquis  de  Ville!,  Go Governor  vernor Governor  of  the  place,  was  disposed  to  accept  of  this  offer  against  which  the  inhabitants  mutinied.  Lord  COCHRANE,  whilst  on  his  station  in  the  Mediter Mediterranean,  ranean, Mediterranean,  raised  even  the  naval  reputation  of  his  country  by  his  intrepidity  and  vigilance.  Notwithstanding  the  limited  means  he  had  at  his  controul,  he  spread  alarm  and  terror,  along  the  enemy's  coast,  from  the  Pyrenees  to  the  Gulph  of  Genoa;  and  his  defense  of  Rosas  has  left  a  splendid  mo monument  nument monument  of  what  British  bravery  is  capable  of  executing  *  when  animated  by  the  example,  and  guided  by  the.  talents  of  a  COCHRANE.

About  six  o'clock  set  off,  on  his  return  to  Windsor.  We  understand  that  Sir  D.  Dundas  is  not  to  hold  the  same  appointment  as  that  of  the  Duke  of  York.

It  seems  that  two  regiments  (of  Militia  as  they  are  called,  but  we  understand  the  whole  Swedish  army  is  of  that  description)  not  having  been  able  to  obtain  their  pay,  expressed  their  resentment  in  a  mutinous  man manlier;  lier; manlier;  and  subordination,  by  the  utmost  exertions  of  the  officers,  could  not  be  restored,  until  their  demands  were  .  fully  satisfied.

The  deceased  was  a  man  of  no  mean  celebrity,  though  no  funeral  escutcheons  adorned  his  hearse,  or  heir  expeet•  ant  graced  his  obsequies,  He  was  no  less  a  personage  than  the  identical  Hugh  Strap,  whom  Dr,  Smollet  has  rendered  so  conspicuously  interesting  in  his  Life  and  Adventures  of  Roderick  Random,  and  for  upwards  of  forty  years  hat  4  kept  a  hair-dresser's  shop  in  the  above  parish.  The  de deceased  ceased deceased  was  a  very  intelligent  man,  and  took  delight  iu  recounting  the  adventures  of  his  early  life.  He  spoke  with  pleasure  of  the  time  he  passed  in  the  service  of  the  Doctor,  and  it  was  his  pride,  as  well  as  boast,  to  say  that  he  had  been  educated  in  the  same  seminary  with  so  learned  and  distinguished  a  character.  His  shop  was  hung  round  with  Latin  quotations,  and  he  would  frequently  point  out  to  hia  customers  and  acquaintances  the  several  scenes  in  Roderick  Random,  pertaining  to  himself,  which  had  their  foundation,  not  in  the  Doctor's  inventive  fancy,  but  in  truth  and  reality.  The  meeting  in  a  barber's  shop  at  Newcastle-upon-Tyne,  the  subsequent  mistake  at  the  inn,  their  arrival  together  in  London,  and  the  assistance  they  experienced  from  Strap's  friend,  were  all  of  that  description.  We  understand  the  deceased  has  left  behind  him  an  interlined  copy  of  Rode Roderick  rick Roderick  Random,  pointing  ocit  these  facts,  shelving  how  far  they  were  indebted  to  the  genius  of  the  Doctor,  and  to  what  extent  they  were  bottomed  in  reality.

0032,"MARCH  26.  FIRE  ARTS.  THE  MONUMENT  Oi  SIR  RALPH  ABERCROMBIE,  EXECUTED  '  BY  WESTMACOTT,  R.  A.  To  perpetuate  the  memory  of  illustrious  actions  as  well  as  the  '  tames  of  Mose  by  whom  such  actions  have  been  performed,  has  been  esteemed  the  province  of  the  arts,  ever  since  the  arts  have  been  in  existence.  Statuary  claims  particularattention  in  this  re respect,  spect, respect,  because  the  materials  it  employs  promise  the  durability  of  ages,  and  the  apparent  difficulty  of  its  labours  awakens  astonish  ment  and  fix  attention.  The  defects  under  which  all  the  per performances  formances performances  of  Statuary  seem  principally  to  be  depressed,  are  a  want  of  distinct  light  and  shadow.  The  glare  of  white  marble  will  not  permit  those  delicate  hollows  which  give  animation  to  features,  and  expression  to  a  whole  figure,  to  be  perceived,  at  any  considerable  distance  ;  and  again  the  general  effect  is  com completely  pletely completely  lost,  if  these  nice  touches  of  the  chissel  are  too  closely  contemplated.  It  is,  therefore,  manifest  that  very  great  atten attention  tion attention  ought  to  be  paid  to  the  position  of  any  piece  of  statuary.  The  light  should  be  contrived  so  to  fall  upon  it  as  to  give  every  possible  advantage  to  the  chief  prominencies  ;  and  if  a  strong  shadow  from  any  part  of  the  building,  in  which  it  is  erected,  can  generally  be  thrown  upon  the  sides  or  inferior  parts  of  the  com composition,  position, composition,  such  a  shadow  ought  not  to  be  neglected.  Indeed  there  seems  to  he  a  great  deal  of  this  sort  of  light  and  shade,  which  the  artist  ought  to  tegard  with  as  much  attention  as  the  architect  undoubtedly  did  in  the  position  of  the  windows  and  columns  of  the  building.  I  am  led  to  these  reflections,  on  the  position  of  pieces  of  statuary,  by  the  subject  under  contemplation.  No  shim shimtion  tion shimtion  could  have  been  more  unfavourable  to  it  than  that  in  which  it  stands.  In  front  the  whole  effect  of  it  is  entirely  lost  ;  and  if  the  spectator  moves  towards  his  left  hand  in  hopes  of  placing  his  eye  in  a  more  commanding  point,  he  soon  finds  himself  wedged  into  a  corner  whence  his  expected  coup  d'eeid  is  contracted  into  a  miserable  side  peep,  which  affords  him  a  very  weak  conception  of  the  whole.  The  window  directly  behind  the  monument  throws  a  dingy  light  upon  the  backs  of  the  heads  of  the  princi principal  pal principal  figures,  and  renders  them  as  flat  and  lifeless,  as  the  profiles  that  are  instantaneously  performed  by  the  new  patent  machine.  Yet  all  this  is  no  further  the  fault  of  the  artist  than  as  the  situation  may  have  been  left  to  his  choice,  or  as  be  may  have  been  compelled  to  conform  himself  to  an  appointed  place.  No  monument  ever  owed  less  to  its  position  than  does  this  labour  of  Mr.  Westmacott.  Placed  in  such  an  unfair  point  of  view,  this  magnificent  group  will  scarcely  meet  the  justice  of  such  critics  as  look  for  general  striking  appearance.  Its  merits  are  obscured;  and,  whatever  deficiencies  it  may  possess,  those  deficiencies  are  strongly  height heightened  ened heightened  by  its  situation.  The  figure  of  Sir  Ralph,  which  is  every  where  intercepted  by  that  of  the  Highlander  who  i•  receiving  him  in  his  arms,  is  still  more  obscured  by  the  light  being  imme immediately  diately immediately  behind  it.  The  features  of  the  magnanimous  Gen°ral,  when  viewed  from  a  small  distance,  are  strongly  marked  with  that  expression  of  resignation  and  victorious  joy  that  elevates  the  man  of  patriotic  courage  ;  the  features  of  the  Highlander  also  are  exquisitely  touched  with  regret  and  warlike  ardour;  but  when  the  spectator  endeavours  to  unite  these  sentiments  to  the  whole  group,  as  it  entirely  is  presented  to  him  at  any  point  of  view  he  may  endeavour  to  obtain,'  he  tinds  no  rF3ible  assimilation  of  ideas  :  the  whole,  as  he  sees  it,  no  where  corresponds  with  its  parts.  But,  whatever  may  be  allowed  for  so  had  a  position,  I  feel  myself  obliged  to  say  that  a  front-view  of  this  monument  could  in  no  direction  of  the  light  be  good.  The  back  of  the  High Highlander  lander Highlander  meets  the  eye  too  prominently  and  destroys  the  interest,  from  the  very  spot  at  which  a  judicious  critic  will  be  the  most  eager  to  observe  it.  It  is  not  but  at  a  considerable  distance,  w  here  every  thing  except  general  effect  :!;  entirely  lost,  that  the  figure  of  Sir  R.  Abercrombie  rises  sufficiently  above  thegroup  his  charger  then  dw  'tllest  ato  a  Galloway  runt,  or  seems  to  be  205  intended  for  oue  of  the  short  steeds  of  the  desart  on  which  we  are  told  the  Mamelukes  were  used  to  make  their  ferocious  excur-  lions:  the  hoisc  gives  us  therefore  the  idea  of  a  conceit  or  misc..  rable  allusion  to  the  country  in  which  the  great  Unintnancler  terminated  his  honourable  career:  I  can  hardly  believe  that  Mr.  Wegtmacott  condescended  to  consult  Theodore  }Wok  !---1  hope  the  reins  and  bit,  hs  well  as  the  spurs  of  Sir  Ralph  are  under  the  chissel  of  Mr.  W.  for  the  leathern  bridle  and  ru4ty  hit,  as  well  as  the  painted  spur  now  attached  to  the  figures  have  a  miserable  appearance.  The  naked  figure  beneath  the  horse  is  a  piece  of  admirable  sculpture.  The  fore-part  of  the  left  ara'  is  however  not  so  well  finished  as  the  rest  of  the  body.  The  extended  hand  upon  the  ground,and  the  indentmeot  of  the  muscles  on  the  shoulder,  are  of  themselves  expressive  of  the  agony  of  intense  pain  ;  while  the  hand  that  still  grasps  at  the  fallen  standard  finely  displays  the  tenacity  of  military  resolution  in  the  moment  of  painful  death.  This  figure,  were  it  original,  would  do  the  sculptor  the  highest  honour.  It  is  however  a  copy.  On  account  of  the  execution,  it  would  be  unseemly  to  regret  the  want  of  uniformity  in  the  costume.  Why  is  the  dying  French  soldier  naked  when  the  British  General  and  the  Highlander  are  correctly  clothed  in  their  proper  garb  ?  surely  it  is  not  the  custom  of  the  British  army  to  strip  the  slain  !  —Or  does  the  artist  mean  this  for  an  allegorical  figure  of  Gallic  power  thus  conquered  and  compelled  to  Lite  the  ground?  In  no  manner  whatsoever  will  it  agree  with  the  rest  of  the  group  :  though  I  must  acknowledge  that  the  worst  that  cam  be  said  of  it  is,  that  it  is  too  good  for  the  rest.  The  Highlander's  left  hand  might  surely  have  been  better  placed  than  under  the  thigh  of  the  General.  The  animation  of  sentiment  is  lost  in  such  a  regular  method  of  helping  a  wounded  man  from  his  horse.  A  common  servant  would  assist  his  master  in  that  manner,  but  an  affectionate  servant,  a  warm-hearted  Highland  soldier,  would  clasp  his  commander  with  less  cere ceremony,  mony, ceremony,  and  would  thereby  impress  the  beholders  with  more  com commiseration.  miseration. commiseration.  The  sphinxes  are  clumsy,  and  are  perhaps  designed  to  be  spee  cimens  of  Egyptian  sculpture.  They  do  no  accord  with  the  group  above  them.  Indeed  the  pedestal  dues  not  sufficiently  elevate  the  monumental  group  above  them,  and  they  have  the  appearance  of  something  more  than  mere  auxiliary  figures.  The  pedestal  ought  to  have  had  more  of  the  Egyptian  character.  With  all  its  faults,  this  is  nevertheless  a  finely  wrought  per performance.  formance. performance.  With  respect  to  secondary  considerations,  such  as  the  turns  of  limbs,  the  ttow  of  drapery,  the  markings  of  features,  and  corporeal  muscles  and  sinews,  it  is  highly  finished,  and  must  he  regarded  as  a  piece  of  workmanship  almost  unrivalled  in  modern  (lines.  But  as  a  whole,  as  a  massive  and  interesting  piece  of  sculpture,  ns  a  group  which  the  pathetic  powers  of  ge genius  nius genius  might  have  exhibited  to  the  feelings  of  a  British  public,  it  is  certainly  very  defective.  Whatever  sensibility  the  sight  of  this  monument  may  awaken,  that  sensibility  will  be  inure  due  to  the  melancholy  and  never-to-he-forgotten  occncion  that  gave  it  rise,  than  to  any  pettims  emanating  from  the  mind  of  the  sculls scullstor.  tor. scullstor.

Ds  OF  THE  FOUNDLING  CII.IPP.t:  •  A  spirit  of  Oriigious  enquiry  seems  generally  excited;  It  was  natural,  hided&amp;  that  successive  ctittracters  of  the  mi ministers  nisters ministers  of  religion,  extensively  disseminated,  should  attract  more  than  usual  attention  towards  religion  itself.

Even  theoretical  infidelity  ceases  now  to  assail  our  ears,  and  insult  our  hearts.  Happy;  therefore;  am  I  to  observe,  independently  and  conscientiously,  of  the  present  preacher,  the  REV.  JOHN  HEWLETT,  that  his  pulpit  labours  are  eminently  calcu calculated  lated calculated  to  impress  the  understandings,  and  improve  the  dispositions,  of  the  numerous  and  respectable  audiences  to  which  they  are  eontinir.lly  addressed.  He  is,  be  it  known,  Morning  Preacher  at  the  Foundling  Hospital  ;  and  his  hearers  being  chiefly  those  who  attend  morning  service,  are  necessarily  less  promiscuous,  and  consequently  more  reputable,  than  numbers  of  such  persons  as  are  seen  thronging  to  the  devotion  of  the  evening.  'The  fact  is  ac acknowledged  knowledged acknowledged  ;  and  the  distinction  is  deserving  of  obser obserration.  ration. obserration.  Of  the  individual  history  of  Mr.  Hewlett,  I  am  enabled  to  state,  accurately  it  is  believed,  that  he  formerly  kept  a  school,  for  some  years,  at  Shacklewell  ;  with  which,  how however,  ever, however,  he  has  parted,  rather  advantageously.  He  is  of  Mag Magdalen  dalen Magdalen  College,  in  Cambridge.  Mr.  Hewlett  is  known  in  the  literary  world,  as  author  of  a  Vindication  of  the  Parian  Chronicle;'  a  tract  which  displays  great  learning  on  the  *abject  of  the  Arundelian  Marbles.  He  has  also  collected  and  published  three  volumes  of  his  Sermons  ;  and  he  is  now  editing  a  New  Edition  of  The  Bible,  originally  under undertaken  taken undertaken  by  the  late  Dr.  Gregory,  which  appears  monthly,  in  parts;  and  which  promises  to  supply  a  truly  valuable  de desideratum  sideratum desideratum  id  our  theological  literature.  It  must  be  seen,  even  Irvin  this  hasty  specification  of  his  exertions,  that  Mr..  Bewlett  is  abundantly  qualified  for  his  clerical  avocations.  There  is  much  impressive  solemnity  both  in  the  person  •od  manner  of  this  preacher.  His  professional  deportment  is  sufficiently  dignified,  and  his  countenance  is  indicative  of  his  sincerity.  His  action,  however,  is  little  varied;  while  his  voice,  naturally  unpowerful,  frequently  becomes  inau inaudible.  dible. inaudible.  This  latter  defect  is  to  be  regretted,  because,  care•  MAIICH  26.  folly  as  Mr.  Hewlett's  Sermons  are  composed,  lie  never  de delivers  livers delivers  an  uninteresting  sentence:  he  says  nothing  but  what  merits  to  be  hearri;  and  much,  very  much,  that  his  hearers  must  be  anxious  to  treasure  up  for  their  own  service.  He  seldom  entangles  himself,  nor  does  he  perplex  others,  with  the  subtilties  of  theology;  or  the  dogmas  of  school-  Practieal,  rather  than  theoretical,  his  reasoning  ap appeals  peals appeals  directly  to  the  understandings  of  his  auditors;  his  il illustrations  lustrations illustrations  are  familiarly  intelligible;  and  his  conclusion*  are  therefore  demonstrative.  Whether  we  are  to  impute  it  to  such  considerations  as  the  foregoing,  Certainly  it  is  sometimes  the  defect  of  Mr.  Hewlett's  discourses,  commonly  with  those  delivered  I.y  many  other  christian  teachers  ;  that  he  expatiates  on  the  necessity  of  possessing  faith  without  explaining  the  method  by  which  it  can  be  obtained.

NA,"THE  NATIONAL  REGISTER.  MARCH  26.  titre  deliberation,  and  however  ungracious  it  might  ap appear,  pear, appear,  after  the  communication  made  b)  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  he  must  still  persist  in  it.  He  had  conscientiously  voted  against  all  the  Addresses  yilti•.-1  went  to  charge  his  Royal  Highness  with  corruption  or  criminal  connivance  (Hear  !  heart)  and  he  perfectly  concurred  hi  thinking  with  his  Right  thin.  Friend  (Mr.  Perceval)  that  ais  Royal  Highness  went  oat  with  clean  hands  (  Hear  !  hear  !  j'eNn  the  Ministerial  bench**.  )  put  after  that  question  was  decided,  he  caw  no  other  course  for  the  House  to  porsoe,  than  that  branch  of  the  inquiry  which  he  had  taken  up.  The  question  of  interference,  without  any  degree  Of  corruption  attaching  to  it—of  interference  arising  from  an  im improper  proper improper  and  unworthy  influence,  appeared  to  him  to  be  one  which  the  House  ought  to  come  to  a  decision  upon.  This  'was  the  view  w  lich  he  took  of  the  subject,  when  he  tirst  sub submitted  mitted submitted  his  Resolution  to  the  llotke,  and  he  had  seen  no  occasion  to  alter  his  opinion.  Some  (cnttemneu  would  have  voted  for  the  more  severe  measures,  had  not  his  intention  of  bringing  for forward  ward forward  his  Resolution  been  known,  and  this  he  thought  a  very  strong  reason  for  not  withdrawing  it.  In  describing  the  connection  which  the  Duke  had  himself  condemned  in  his  letter,  but  only  in  one  place,  and  then  oul  y  with  a  reftvence  to  the  unpleasant  pt  o-  Feedings  which  had  re  s  ulted  from  it,  he  had  expre  , STYLE=superscript  sed  his  sense  of  the  initnorldity  of  the  transaction.  It  had  been  argued  that  the  House  was  a  very  improper  judge  upon  such  occasions;  but  where  a  connection  might  have  led  to  such  dangerous  conse consequences  quences consequences  to  the  State,  he  fii4  not  see  how  the  House  co  uld STYLE=superscript  withhold  its  opinion.  The  Right  Honourable  Gentleman  concluded  with  moving  the  following  Resolution,  44 STYLE=superscript  That  while  this  House  acknowledges,  with  gratitude,  the  beneficial  'effects  of  the  rules  and  regulations  introduced  by  the  Duke  of  York  into  the  office  of  Commander  in  Chief,  and.  the  general  improvement  of  the  army  under  his  command,  it  has  seen,  with  sleep  regret,  that  a  connection  the  most  immoral  and  unbecom-  Ow  6,  was  attended  with  impropercommunication  and  i STYLE=superscript  n  terfere STYLE=superscript  n  ce, STYLE=superscript  and  gave  colour  and  effect  to  transactions  the  most  criminal  and  'disgraceful.''  Sir  WtI.I.IAM  CuRTIs  supported-the  Motion,  Lord  A  L  - STYLE=superscript  rn  on  PE  was  of  opinion  that  the  Duke  of  York  had  been  guilty  of  corrupt  connivance  (Hear!  Hear!)  hut  he  thought  the  country  would  now  be  *satisfied  with  his  'removal.  should  therefore  propose  as  an  amendment  to  the  Right  Hon.  tientleman's  Resolution,  that  his  Royal  Highness  the  Duke  of  York  having  resigned  the  office  of  Comumader•  in  Chief,  the  House  does  not  feel  it  necessary  to  proceed  any  further  into  the  consideration  of  the  minutes  of  the  evidence  before  the  House,  as  far  as  they  relate  to  the  Duke  of  York,  The  CLIANcO.I.Oft  of  the  EXCIIEWIER  said,  he  preferred  the  Amendment  of  the  'Noble  Lord  to  the  :notion  of  ilk  Right  lion.  Friend,  which  appeared  to  him  n:  tp  ported  by  any  evidence  at  the  bar.  ile  should  I;at  ny  time  have  thought  it  necessary,  aud  still  less  so  at  the  present,  when  his  Royal  Highness  had  sent  in  his  resignation.  Lord  TEMPLE  stated,  that  when  he  heard  the  Commander  in  chief  had  resigned,  he  thought  further  proceedings  unnecessary,  but  that  opinion  was  altered  when  he  heard  the  communication  of  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  and  the  tone  in  which  that  communication  was  made,  when  he  said  his  Royal  High Highpess  pess Highpess  did  not  resign  until  his  innocence  was  declared  (hear!  hear!)  The  Noble  Lord  acquitted  his  Royal  Highness  of  cor corruption'  ruption' corruption'  ;  but  asked  if  it  could  he  said  that  he  was  acquitted  of  dispef;ing  of  places  in  his  patronage  under  an  unworthy  and  un unbecoMing  becoMing unbecoMing  influence  (  hear  !  hear  !).  Mr,  WIIITIMEAn  concurred  in  the  Amendment  proposed  by  the  Noble  Lord.  He  explained  his  roasons  at  length,  and  ad..  verted  to  some  points  of  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  s  speech.  He  did  not  think  there  was  any  man  in  existence,  who  could  have  thought,  after  the  result  of  the  Joe  inquiry  in  this  Ilituse,  and  the  vote  given  on  Friday  last,  that  the  Duke  of  York  would  have  remained  in  the  situation  which  he  occupied,  lint  now  that  he  had  resigned,  he  thought  a  motion  which  war  intei  ded  to  enforce  his  resignation,  quite  unnecessary.  It  would  annihilate  that  secret,  felt  though  unseen,  party,  which  Lord  Chatham  had  represented  as  standing  behind  the  Throne,  and  stronger  than  the  Throne  itself.  He  did  not  approve  of  a  moral  lecture  to  lie  delivered  to  Princes.  The  Princes  belonging  to  the  Royal  Family  in  this  kingdom.were  compelled  to  marry  against  their  will,  and  therefore  almost  forced  into  guilt  by  the  rebellious  feelings  of  independent  nature.  He  vindicated  Mr.  Wardle's  conduct  it  bringing  forward  t  h STYLE=superscript  e  p  resent STYLE=superscript  Inquiry,  aod  congratulated  him  on  the  199  Members  of  the  House  of  Commons,  that  could  not  fail  to  thank  him  for  his  courage  and  patriotism.  The  CLIANOCLLOR  of  the  EICUSQUER  repelled  AO  charge  197  of  having  abandoned  the  Duke,  who  had  acted  from  his  own  free  will,  unbiassed  by  advice.  Mr.  BATHURST  replied  at  length,  Isad  the  House  divided.  The  Numbers  for  the  Chancellor's  Amendment  were  Against  it  I  Is—Majority  in  favour  of  Ministers  123.  Lord  FOTASTO  ME  also  put  oil  his  notice  of  Motion  from  Mona  .  day  nett,  fortaltini  into  further  consideration  the  Report  of  the  Cummtttee  Appointed  to  enquire  into  the  conduct  of  his  Royal  Iligimea  the  'Duke  of  York,  until  the  17th  of  April  next.  —  Adjourned  Tuesday,  Mare:  21.

Bon,  recurred  to  u  long  series  of  documents  in  the  Reports  of  the  Committees  of  Finance  and  of  Naval  Revision,  and  took  an  his historical  torical historical  view  of  the  state  of  the  Navy  at  different  periods,  in  or order  der order  as  well  to  she  w  that  that  state  was  always  affected  either  by  the  possession  or  the  want  of  professional  experience  in  those  who  at  different  times  undertook  its  management,  and  directed  its  operations,  as  to  prove,  that  within  the  present  reign,  for  the  want  of  such  experience,  ability,  and  industry  in  those  who  at  different  periods  superintended  the  various  branches  of  naval  extraditure,  the  most  gross  and  flagitious  profusion,  improvi improvidence,  dence, improvidence,  and  pecilation  had  prevailed  in  our  dock•yards  at  home,  and  our  Beets  in  foreign  service;  and.  that  the  public  accounts  in  that  department  had  been  suffered  to  run  into  such  arrear  and  confusion,  as  to  render  the  audit  of  them  totally  impracticable,  for  a  series  of  twenty  years  together,  to  the  preclusion  of  all  etl'ectual  means  to  c  :eck  the  progress  of  peculation  and  fraud  .  When  the  urgent  a:7lirs  of  this  country  called  for  great  ex.  penditure.  and  consequently  for  a  heavy  pressure  of  taxation  on  the  people,  it  was  hut  right  and  reasonable  that  the  people  should  be  convinced  that  a  scrupulous  and  efficient  yigilatae  was  exerted  in  every  department  of  office,  in  order  to  secure  the  fair  application  of  every  shilliug  granted  for  the  public  service;  and  his  principal  motive  for  now  calling  the  attention  or  the  !louse  to  this  suhje.t,  was  not  to  cast  any  blame  on  the  present  Board  of  Adonira!ty,  but  in  order  to  record  on  the  Jour Journak  nak Journak  of  the  House  a  resolution  which  he  should  have  the  honour  to  propose  now,  That  it  is  the  opinion  of  this  Hoose  that  neither  the  plan  recommended  by  the  Commis 'Commis'  sioncrs  of  Naval  it  evision,,,Sespecting  the  Victualling  Board,  nor  any  other  plan  can  he  effectual,  if  that  Board  be  coin 'coin'  posed  of  any  other  than  men  of  extensive  experience,  know know!  ! know!  ledge,  ability,  integrity,  and  indefatigable  perseverance  in  their,ditties.  •  .  •  •  :wt  r.

The  motion  went  to  charge  the  Admi Admiralty  ralty Admiralty  with  blame  without  a  single  argument  in  support  of  it.  —  He  was,  therefore,  compelted  to  move  the  previous  question.  Sir  C.  POLE  shortly  replied,  and  the  previous  question  was  then  carried  without  a  division.  Mr.  FosTeß  moved,  the  the  Order  of  the  Day  for  the  com committal  mittal committal  of  the  Irish  Malt  and  Spirit  Duty  Bill  should  De  read.  His  object  was  to  postpone  its  committal  to  Thursday  next,  as  he  did  not  think  a  Bill  so  materially  affecting  Ireland  could  be  pro properly  perly properly  discussed  in  so  thin  a  House.  Sir  3.  NEWPORT  said,  he  rose  for  the  purpose  of  moving,  not  that  this  Bill  should  be  postponed  to  Thursday,  but  to  this  day  six  months—a  Bill  which  be  thought  fraught  with  the  most  evil  consequences  to  Ireland,  and  teading  to  endanger  the  peace  of  the  whole  Eampire.  A  long  conversation  then  took  place  upon  the  subject,  in  which  Mr.  W.  Smith,  Mr.  Barham,  Mr.  Leslie  rester,  the  chancelloo  of  the  Exchequer  , STYLE=superscript  M  r.

MARCH  26.  Motion;  to  which  Lord  ALTHOR  PC  proposed  an  Amendment,  stating  that  as  his  Royal  Highness  resigned  the  command  of  the  army,  the  House  does  not  think  It  necessary  now  to  proceed  any  further.  To  this  Mr.  PEKCEVA  L  moved  an  Amendment,  that  the  word  now  he  omitted.  Mr.  PERCIVA.  es  Amendment  was  earried  by  a  majority  of  235  to  112.  Lord  FOLKESTONE  has  given  notice  of  his  intention  to  make  some  further  statements  respecting  his  Royal  Highness,  on  the  11th  of  next  month.  As  far  as  it  aas  possible  to  ascertain  the  public  opinion  on  this  momentous  goestinn,  it  seemed  to  coincide,  at  least,  in  the  neces-  sity  in  which  the  DuliZ  of  YORK  wai  placed  to  renounce  his  ap appointment  pointment appointment  of  Commander  in  chief.  Whatever  maybe  the  sentiment  of  his  guilt  and  innocence,  the  feeling,  we  will  risk  to  say,  was  general,  that  his  Royal  Highness  had  given  proofs  of  weakness  and  inconsiderateness,  to  speak  of  him  as  tenderly  as  possible,  which  disqualified  him  for  an  office  of  such  great  respotisi,  bility.  As  to  his  military  talents  we  will  say  little  ;-..they  never  produced  a  single  brilliant  advantage  to  his  country.  As  to  the  services  he  may  have  rendered  in  his  capacity  of  commander  in  Chief;--we  would  he  the  last  persons  in  esistence  to  detract  from  them,  either  from  party  motives,  or  private-  malignity  ;  but  it  is  impossible  to  impute  to  his  single  exertions,  activity  or  patriotism,  any  amelioration  which  may  have  taken  place  in  the  militpry  department.  This  amelioration,  should,  with  more  propriety,  be  attributed  to  the  menacing  and  accumulating  dan dangers  gers dangers  of  our  situation  ;—They  were  so  urgent  as  to  fix  a  mass  of  talents  and  attention  on  that  department,  This  collection  of  means  and  knowledge  and  circumstances  must  necessarily  have  operated  beneficially  on  the  army  ;  and  it  has  become,  w  hat  it  now  is,  the  terror  of  our  enemy,  and  the  ad admiration  miration admiration  of  every  man  who  has  attentively  examined  its  organi organization.  zation. organization.  Therefore,  we  are  far  from  thinking  that  other  Officers  are  not,  at  least,  as  fully  competent  to  fill  so  important  an  office  as  his  Royal  Highness  ;  or  that  any  relaxation  of  zeal  or  discipline  will  be  apparent  now  that  the  1)t:  ter,  of  YORK  has  yielded  to  the  unanimous  voice  of  the  Public.  The  crimi criminal  nal criminal  weakness  he  displayed  during  his  connection  with  Mrs.  CLARKE  rendered  his  resignation  not  only  urgent  but  indis indispensible  pensible indispensible  ;  and  we  are  happy  to  perceive  that  the  DUKE  has  complied  with  - STYLE=superscript  this  necessity.  It  is  impossible  not  to  advert  on  this  - STYLE=superscript  occasion  to  the  enlight enlightened  ened enlightened  principles  of  our  constitution,  which  enable  the  public  opinion  to  exercise  a  controul  so  beneficial  and  decisive,  over  the  servants  of  the  state.  The  public  judgment  may  err,  but  the  public  feeling  never  ;  and  though  a  great  mass  of  the  people  may  have  peen  incompetent  to  unravel  the  perplexing  mass  of  evidence  laid  before  the  House  of  Commons,  and  discriminate,  with  the  over  nice  distinction  of  the  bar,  between  specious  and  positive  wilt;  there  was  not  a  single  individual  of  that  number,  however  limited  his  intellectual  bense,  that  had  not  moral  sense  enough  to  perceive,  that  the  writer  of  the  letters  to  Mrs.  CL4ELKE  was  not  a  fit  person  to  be  intrusted  with  an  office  of  high  responsibility.  It  is  as  difficult  to  pass  over  the  manly,  firm,  and  patriotic  i  conduct  of  Mr.  WARDLE,  who  brought  forward  these  ch:lrges,  under  difficulties  and  menaces,  which  induced  a  number  or  per persons,  sons, persons,  who  admired  his  conduct,  to  tremble  at  the  consequeoces  of  his  zeal,  integrity,  and  patriotism.  It  would  betray  a  pro profound  found profound  ignorance  of  our  history,  as  of  the  abuses  inseparable  from  power,  to  overlook  the  important  advantages  the  people  acquire  from  having  a  man  of  his  ivaexibility,  and  courage,  in  the  number  of  their  representatives.  He  has  merited  in  a  full  measure  the  thanks  of  his  country  ;  and  we  are  happy  to  perceive  that  the  citizens  of  Canterbury,  have  voted  him  the  freedom  of  their  accompanied  with  their  thanks  for  the  manner  in  which  he  conducted  the  proceedings  on  the  charges  against  the  late  Com•  wander  in  Chief.  The  Cities  of  Glasgow  and  Rochester  have  con convened  vened convened  meetings  fur  the  same  patriotic  purpose  ;  and  we  trust  this  hoLourable  example  will  be  followed  by  every  other  corporation  iu  the  United  Kingdom.  This  is  the  fittest  recompance  for  men  w  ho  201  render  distinguished  services  to  their  country  ;—it  resembles  the  civic  crown,  the  laurel  branch,  conferred  by  the  ancients  0Q  their  benefactors  and  heroes.  A  remuneration  in  money  was  thought  of  when  the  exertions  of  individuals  tended  more  to  promote  the  views  of  the  Prince,  than  the  interests  of  thecom thecommunity.  munity. thecommunity.  Sir  DAVID  DUNDAS  was  presented,  on  Wednesday  to  his  MAJESTY  at  the  Levee,  upon  receiving  his  appointment  as  Commander  in  Chief,  and  was  sworn  iu  a  member  of  the  Privy  Conseil.  He  is  a  brave  and  meritorious  Officer  ;  but  me  would  rather  see  this  important  Office  entrusted  to  a  Military  Board,  nu  a  plan  somewhat  similar  to  that  of  the  Board  of  idnxi idnxirnity,  rnity, idnxirnity,  Letters  dated  the2tst  inst.  have  been  received  from  Ifol Ifolland.  land.

They  do  not  corroborate  the  previous  accounts,  re received  ceived received  through  the  same  channel,  of  hostilities  baying  ac actually  tually actually  commenced  between  Austria  and  France.  The  ex extreme  treme extreme  caution  they  observe  in  adverting  to  the  occurrences  in  Germany  is  a  proof  of  the  rigorous  precautions  which  have  been  adopted  to  prevent  intelligence  of  the  real  state  of  that  country  being  transmitted  to  this.  By  a  carmpa carmpathon  thon carmpathon  of  their  contents,  the  following  particulars:  may,  however,  be  collected  and  relied  on,—The  Austrian  armies  are  universally  in  motion  ;  and  are  far  more  numerous,  formidable,  and  better  organised,  than  they  have  been  represented  in  the  papers  under  the  controul  of  the  tyrant.  They  have  arrived  before  now,  amply  and  better  supplied  than  in  any  former  campaign,  with  every  article  essential  to  a  vigorous  prosecution  of  ilostilities,  at  their  respectise  places  of  desteettion,  and  have  probably  sustained  already  the  first  shock  ..of  the  enemy.

The  militia  evince  as  much  zeal  :cud  alacrity  as  the  regular  corps;  and  the  Ilungari:ms,  so  often  the  terror,  and  in  a  crisis  almost  equally  dangerous,  the  last  prop  of  the  Empire,  display  as  much  ardour  on  the  re resent  sent resent  occasion,  as  they  did  in  that  memorable  one,  sslien  they  stepped  forward  to  support  the  rights  of  Mattis  THE THERESA  RESA THERESA  against  the  united  efforts  of  France,  Prussia,  Spain  and  Bavat  ia.  The  following  facts  may  likewise  be  relied  on.  A  strong  :ermentation  exists  in  Tyrol;  and  these  brave  Mountaineets  have  exhibited  such  marks  of  disaffection  to  the  Bavarian  Government,  that  the  greater  part  of  the  BA  varian  troops  has  been  ordered,  muter  •  Baron  Vos  WnEosl,  to  keep  them  in  awe.  Sentiments,  equally  fevourn  We  to  the  cause  of  Austria  is  going  to  contend  for,  are  manifested,  though  not  so  openly,  by  all  the  States  that  have  volitatarily  entered,  or  been  presse4  into  the  Rhenish  Confede Confederacy.  racy.

The  desertion  from  the  Bavarian  and  Wurtemberg  troops  was  so  universal,  that  it  was  foutvi  expedient,  towards  the  end  of  last  month,  to  remove  them  to  a  greater  distance  from  the  Austrian  frontiers.'  The  co-operation  of  Saxony  in  this  iniquitous  aggression,  is  not  only  doelkful  but  may  be  denied  with  safety.  •  And,  if  we  take  the  raoral  character  of  the  Sovereign,  the  feelings  of  the  Saxo,is  and  the  long longestablished  established longestablished  family  alliance  between  the  twa  courts,  into  consideration,  we  feel  less  hesitation  to  discredit  the  re reported  ported reported  repugnance  of  that  Prince  to  contribute  to  the  :rser :rserthrow  throw :rserthrow  of  Austria.

The  same  warning  has  been  frequently  given  to  other  governments  on  occasions  less  terrific  ;  anti  they  rejected  it  with  the  same  overweening  ioufidence,  as  we  seen!  to  do  in  this  moment;  --they  gave  likewise  a  preference  to  the  weak  policy  of  reserving  their  armies  for  the  eventual  dangers  that  might  occur.  not  reflecting  that,  when  they  arrived,  hew  incompetent  their  single  efforts  were  to  meet  them.
