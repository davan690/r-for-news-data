0017,"THE  NATIONAL  REGISTER;  EASTER  HOLIDAYS.  The  sports  of  this  festival  commenced  Monday,  and  the  Ispm Ispmbre  bre Ispmbre  sadness  of  Passion  Week  was  succeeded  by  the  gas  hustle  of  holiday  folks,  the  opening  of  the  Summer  Theatres,  and  a  variety  of  customary  scenes,  which  are  hailed  with  pleasure  by  the  iuha iuhatants  tants iuhatants  of  our  metropolis.  •  EPPING  HU  NT.—Yesterday,  at  an  early  hour,  the  industri industrious  ous industrious  sons  of  Spitaltields,  Bethnal  Green,  and  Whitechapel,  dis disdaining  daining disdaining  the  semnific  powers,  rose  at  the  blush  of  Aurora,  and  prepared  for  the  far-famed  Epping  Hunt,  big  with  the  fate  of  Cockneys.  The  road  from  town  to  the  sportive  scene  was  throriged  by  hunters  of  every  description.  Some  were  heavily  dressed,  and  others  as  hare  of  covering  as  Meleager  when  le.  killed  the  Celedonian  hoar.  The  gallant  troop  displayed  all  the  colours  of  gay  Iris,  and  sable  bearings  of  a  chimney-sweeper  were  often  blazoned  by  the  powderings  of  barber's  apron.  The  cattle  were  composed  of  horses,  asses,  and  mules,  all  high  in  bone,  and  low  in  flesh  ;  and  the  pack  displayed  every  class  of  the  canine  species,  from  the  hull  to  the  lapdog.  After  having  regaled  with  copious  libations  of  genera,  the  motley  groups  ar arrived  rived arrived  at  the  Eagle,  Snaresbrook,  and  other  houses  contiguous  to  the  forest.  A  fine  stag  had  been  previously  carried  from  a  sta stable.  ble. stable.  Hi?,  horns  were  sawed  off,  as  usual,  except  the  front  ant antlers,  lers, antlers,  which  were  braided  with  ribbands,  and  he  was  turned  out  to  the  mercy  of  his  pursuers,  near  Buckets-hill.  Finding  him himself  self himself  at  liberty,  he  dashed  into  Fair-maid  Bottom,  and  sought  re refeee  feee refeee  in  the  Forest.  The  scent  was  then  givea,  and  off  went  the  Like  wind  and  tide  In  a  few  moments  the  ground  was  covered  with  hats,  wigs,  and  the  bodies  of  fat  Citizens.  Riders  were  seen  looking  for  their  horses,  and  horses  for  their  riders.  The  venders  of  gin  and  eat eatahles,  ahles, eatahles,  v,  ho  stood  prepared  for  the  scene,  immediately  rushed  in  to  dispose  of  their  ware,  and  glasses  of  coreial  consoled  the  downcast  hunters  for  bruises  and  pain.  Several  Nimrods,  who  had  pursued  the  sport  of  the  day  in  taxed  carts,  tvere  overthrown  with  the  loss  of  their  wheels,  and  the  coufti-ioa  which  prevailed  produced  coesiderable  mirth,  at  the  ex  pence  or  tailors,  tali  ow  -  chandlers,  weavers,  and  soap-boilers,  who  had  not  been  able  to  restrain  the  fury  of  their  vicious  kicking  donkeys,  and  tins tinschievous  chievous tinschievous  cart-horses.  The  stag,  as  usual,  escaped  from  the  fury  of  its  unqualified  pursuers,  and  many  of  the  hunters  who  had  lost  their  horses  returned  on  foot  to  the  Bald-faced  Stag,  to  celebrate  their  lucky  escape  from  the  perils  of  the  chace.  After  sacri sacri.ing  .ing sacri.ing  at  the  shrine  of  the  Jolly  God,  they  returned  to  town.

She  lived  rather  too  long  for  her  fame,  but  not  long  enough  for  her  friends.  Miss  Seward  was  daughter  of  the  Rev.  Dr.  Seward,  who  for formerly  merly formerly  held  considerable  cleric;d  preferineht.  Mr.  Seward  paid  very  anxious  attention  to  his  daughter's  intellectual  improvement,  having  conceived,  very  justly,  the  most  favourable  opinioa  of  her  mental  powers.  She  was  born,  about  the  ear  1743,  at  the  village  of  Evam,  in  Derbyshire.  of  which  her  father  was  then  rector.  lie  became  afterwards  Prebendary  of  Salisbury,  and  Cannon-  Residentiary  of  Litchfield.

Her  Literary  Correspondence  was  widely  extensive,  and  highly  respectable.  Anna  Seward  was  once  as  admired  for  the  splendour  of  her  sexual  beauties,  as  for  the  lit-Oh:toe  , STYLE=superscript  of  h,o-  liter,try  reputation.  she  was  highly  accomplished  ;  an,i  morn  e  , STYLE=superscript  ;eeme  f-r  the  sua suavity  vity suavity  of  her  manners,  as  well  as  the  imeiestin::  vivacity  of  h.er  convetsation.

These  countries  fell  an  easy  prey,  because  the  inhabitants  looked'  up  to  the  wisdom  and  energy  of  their  toverninents,  to  or.;  divary  expedients  in  a  case  of  extraordinary  emergency  —when  these  were  found  ineffectual,  they  had  no  other  resource  in  reserve  ;.  and  they  submitted,  to  *ilent'  despon despondency,  dency, despondency,  to  a  calamity,  which  their  vaunted  establishments,  formerly  their  pride  and  security,  bad  not  been  able  to  avert.

This  resolution  and  this  necessity  have  enabled  them  to  resist  the  utmost  pressure  of  the  enemy's  strength.  Their  preparations  have`  not  - STYLE=superscript  abated,  their  confidence  in  the  Ohl.  ?  mate  success  of  their  exertions  has  increased,  instead  of  having  diminished  ;  and,  from  one  extremity  of  the  Penin-:  sula  to  the  other,  the  natives  are  making  the  most  virroutt  preparations  to  secure  this  desirable  object:  .•  .  •  We  have  sum  a  letter  from  Alicaut,  though  not  of  a  very  recent  dale  (the  15th  of  Feb.)  which  increases  its  interest;  it  gives  the  most  satisfactory  account  ..of  the  vigorous  preparations  made  by  that  city,  in'  common•with  every  city  and  town  in  the  south.

The  spirit  of  the  citizens  is  as  unabated  as  when  they  forced  Moneey  to  fly  precipitately  from  their  walls.  They  seem  determined  to  imitate  the  glorious  example  given  by  the  Saragossans.  When  we  look  to  the  North,  we  find  the  same  motives  of  hope  and  encouragement.  The  Asturians  have  already  quitted  their  mountains,  and  have  had  .some  successful  rect.  !  counters  with  the  enemy.  The  Gallicians  are  imitating;  the  general  example,  and  have  cut  to  pieces  several  small  detachments  of  their  invaders.

0020,"TIIE  NATIONAL  REGIS'  IL  g.  .  .  From  this  view  of  the  present  state  of  the  Peninsula,  it  is  easy  to  anticipate  the  most  brilliant  result  to  the  expedition  which  is  preparing  to  sail  under  Sir  Arthur  Wellesley.  It  will  amount  iu  the  first  instance,  to  altout  30,Q00  men,  a  larg  e  force  of  cavalry  and  artillery  inclu includem.  dem. includem.

After  the  distinguished  services  which  that  young  and  meritorious  officer  rendered  at  the  battle  of  Vimiera,  we  trust  that  the  independence  anti  integrity  he  displayed,  during  the  late  investigation,  will  not  be  considered  by  his  Majesty's  Ministeri  as  a  'disqualification  to  future  pro promotion,  motion, promotion,  and  the  further  exercise  of  his  professional  talents.

We  will,  therefore,  .rather  suppose  that  it  is-the  reported  indis indisposition  position indisposition  of  'General  .

We  have  reason,  how however,  ever, however,  to  think  that  so  enterprising  an  ollicer,with  the  powers  entrusted'  to  hiin,  will  seize,  with  avidity,  the  present  aus auspicious  picious auspicious  moment  to  act  on  the  offensive.

We  believe  this  report  Originates  in  an  artifice,  too  successfully  practised  by  the  tyrant.  He  orders  a  number  of  rumours,  highly  disadvantageous  to  his  character,'  but  which  are  false  to  be  circulated  ;  that  the  persons,  who  arc  thus  deluded,  might  afterwards  disbe disbelieve  lieve disbelieve  facts  which  are  tru.  The  accounts  which  have  reached  Government  from  Hand  state,  that  General  Du  PONT,  who  surrendered  at  Baylen  to  CASTANOS  and  REDING,  had  been  tried  by  a  Court  Martial  and  condemned  to  death.  The  Sentence  was  shortly  afterwards  put  into  execution,  and  the  unfmtunate  DUPONT  was  shot  by  torch-light—  This  act  of  cruelty  evinces  no  less  the  noture  of  the  military  system  which  the  tyrant  wishes  to  uphold,  than  the  malignity  of  his  own  heart.  With  the  despot  of  the  Continent  to  be  unsuccessful  is  to  be  guilty.  We  learn  that  the  fate  of.  General  DUPONT  had  excited  among  the  principal  and  subordinate  Officers  of  the  French  army  considerable  discontent.  .  They  must  now  be  sensible,  that  they  cannot  aspire  to  the  favour  of  so  inexorable  a  Master,.  unkss  they  command  events  ;  and  that  in  case  of  failure  they  have  qo  alternative  but  to  perish  on  the  field  of  battle,  or  to  be  consigned  to  an  ignominious  death.

Prayer,  presenting  the  sole  medium  of  intercourse  be between  tween between  the  Creature  and  his  Creator,  between  humanity  and  divinity,  forms  one  of  the  most  important  offices  in  which  the  race  of  man  can  possibly  engage.  Numerous  are  the  formularies  of  devotional  intercession,  national  as  well  as  individual,  written  by  divers  pious  persons,  which  have  accordingly  appeared  in  aid  of  religious  prayer.  Christianity  has  been  eminently  productive  of  such  coin  positions.  Many  of  our  most  distinguished  characters  among  the  laity,  as  clergy,  in  state  as  in  church,  have  bequeathed  to  us  inestimable  examples  of  pious  prayers.  As  to  this  part  of  national  devotion,  common  'prayer,  it  is  difficult  to  conceive,  at  the  present  distance  of  time,  the  veneration  in  which  it  was  held  by  our  venerable  ancestors.  44 STYLE=superscript  It  is  not  without  a  said  the  noble  Bacon,  when  he  was  Chancellor  of  England,  in  one  of  his  Charges  to  the  King's  Verge,  4i STYLE=superscript  that  Christ's  coat  had  no  seam;  ricir  no  more  should  the  Church,  if  it  were  possible.

Thereasons  assigned  for  praying  by  printed  prayers  are  much  the  same  as  those  which  sometimes  defend  the  preaching  of  written  sermons,  Propriety,  perhaps  even  expediency,  suggests  the  necessity  of  especially  attending  to  the  decency  of  Divine  Service  in  the  former  particular.

Of  the  meto•dratnatic  spectacle  entitled  Albert  and  .4  dela,  which  was  next  presented  to  view,  it  is  not  possible  to  speak  in  terms  of  high  commendation.  There  is  something  of  plot,  and  even  nnder-plot,  about  this  piece:  hut,  perhaps,  owing  to  the  restrictions  to  which  theatrical  representation  is  confined  at  these  places,  it  failed  to  interest  the  feelings  of  the  audience;  and,  however  splendid  in  scenery,  scarcely  retained  their  uttentioa  as  spectators.  Its  best  merit  consisted  in  its  developing,  though  not  with  sufficient  force,  practices  of  Inqui Inquisition  sition Inquisition  Tribunals.  Many  of  its  processions  were  really  striking.  Whether  this  was  occasioned  by  the  mob  in  the  Ride,  who  could  with  difficulty  crowd  themselves  upon  the  stage.  so  it  was,  however,  that  the  good  were  not  fully  satisfied  with  the  Horsemanship  of  the  night.  It  was  contrived,  there therefore,  fore, therefore,  by  means  of  a  truly  Comic  Song  in  Character,  or  the  Irish  Cabin,  by  Mr.  Nessus,  to  keep  up  the  play  of  mirth.

The  three  regiments  of  Foot  Guards  are,  by  order  of  Sir  David  Dundas,  the  new  Commander  in  Chief,  to  be  reduced  to  their  original  complement  of  six  thousand  men  ;  the  battalions  which  are  doing  duty  at  Chatham;  &amp;c.  are  to  be  called  in,  and  likewise  all  recruiting  parties,  and  the  whole  corps  is  in  future  to  be  confined,  as  to  duty,  to  London  and  Windsor.  General  Brenier,  who  was  taken  prisoner  in  the  battle  of  Vimiera,  is  either  gone,  or  is  about  to  take  his  departure  for  France.  The  exchange  of  General  Abercrombie  has  not,  we  believe,  been  yet  effected,  though  there  is  some  ground  for  hoping  that  the  proposition  to  exchange  him  fo.ii  Brenier  will  he  accepted.  General  Abercombie  is  now  at  Verdun,  as  has  been  stated  in  most  of  the  papers.

Yearly  the  whole  of  the  foundation  of  the  late  Drury  Lane  Theatre  remains  perfect,  and  the  immense  archways  are  uninjured,  which  will  be  a  very  considerable  saving  in  the  event  of  the  re-building  a  new  Theatre.  The  materials  now  on  the  ground  are  estimated  to  be  worth  12,000/.  and  the  workmen  are  making  great  progress  in  piling  the  bricks  and  removing  the  rubbish.  POLICE.  Ms  tt  T.nostottotr-STa  ET.—A  man  of  fashion,  whose  name  it  would,  perhaps,  be  imprudent  at  present  to  meution,  has  been  'several  days  in  confinement,  on  the  charge  of  having  been  guilty  of  a  disgusting  crime  in  the  Park,  about  ten  days  ago.  He  yesterday  underwent  a  second  examination.  The  witnesses  against  him  were  two  persons  of  good  character,  who  saw  the  transaction.  A  soldier  belonging  to  the  Guards  was  the  pri-.  soner's  companion  at  the  time  of  his  detection  ;  but  the  former  escaped  %k  ith  the  aid  of  a  bludgeon  he  held  in  his  hand.  The  pri.  sinter  carefully  hid  his  face,  yesterday,  during  his  examination  w  ith  a  handkerchief  he  held  against  his  forehead,  so  that  no  one  could  possibly  identify  his  person.  He  was  committed.  •  Another  charge  of  a  different  nature  was  heard  a  few  days  ago  which  will  furnish  matter  for  a  Jury,  highly  disgraceful  to  the  accused.  The  charge  is  against  a  person  in  good  circumstances  for  violating  the  daughter  of  his  friend,  a  child  twelve  years  old,  and  in  the  lonise  of  her  parent.  The  offender  is  the  child's  god godfather,  father, godfather,  a  circumstance  which  adds  to  the  enormity  of  the  offence.

They  gave  her  ten  shillings  with  marks  on  them,  by  which  they  could  identify  them,  and  sent  her  to  purchase  twenty  counterfeit  shillings,  on  Saturday  evening,  to  Bowles's  house.  The  officers  waited  on  the  outside  of  the  house  s  ,  and,  on  her  coming  out,  and  learning  that  she  had  made  her  purchase,  they  knocked  at  the  door,  and  having  gained  admittance,.  they  searched  Bowles  and  his  wife,  and  found  upon  her  the  ten  marked  shillings,  which  the  woman  had  paid  for  the  purchase  of  the  .counterfeit  shillings,  and  160  counterfeit  snillings.

A  meeting  was  appointed  in  a  field  near  the  town,  but  a  difficulty  occurred  in  procuring  weapons.
