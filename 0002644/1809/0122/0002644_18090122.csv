Whatever  confidence  we  may  place  in  the  en:lin en:linsiastic  siastic en:linsiastic  courage  of  our  fellow  citizens;  and  however  certain  we  may  be  of  the  ultimate  extermination  of  the  invaders,  we  still  Inflect  wits  horror  on  the  misery,  desolsption  and  disorder,  that  mutt  accompany  their  footsteps,  Then  , STYLE=superscript  banditti  would  fall  victims  to  British  patriotism;  but  betom  they  fall.  there  is  not  a  family  in  England  that  would  not  have  cause  to  mourn  the  death  of  a  son,  or  husband,  and  the  outraged  virtue  of  a  daughter.  There  is  surely  none  among  us,  however  desirous  he  may  be  to  signalize  him himself  self himself  iu  the  service  of  his  country,  that  does  not  heartily  de deprecate  precate deprecate  the  possibility  of  a  similar  visitation.  This  calamitous  occurrence  is,  as  we  have  already  ob observed,  served, observed,  sooner  or  later  unavoidable,  should  the  enemy  be become  come become  uncontroulled  master  of  the  Continent,  by  the  con conquest  quest conquest  of  Spain.  On  the  occurrences  in  that  country  we  must  invariably  fix  our  attention  ;  and,  however  alarming  or  unpromising  the  present  aspect  of  its  affairs  may  be,  the  more  powerful  inducement  we  have  to  multiply  our  efforts  in  support  of  its  independence.  Nobody  will  deny  the  advantage  of  fighting  the  enemy  on  Spanish  ground,  rather  than  on  our  own,  or  in  Ireland.  If  honour,  there therefore,  fore, therefore,  and  the  pleasuac  of  rescuing  innocence  and  justice  faom  the  gripe  of  oppression  and  villainy,  have  no  influ influence  ence influence  on  our  determination,  let  the  most  imperious  interest,  and  the  strong  cry  of  self-preservation,  keep  us  faithful  to  our  engagements.

Every  day,  every  week,  is  a  new  addition  of  'strength  to  them,.  and  a  diminution  of  that  of  the  enemy.  They  are  hurled  into  that  extraordinary  crisis,  which  it  sure  of  generating  great  talents  and  virtues.  Through  unavoidable  circumstances,  the  management  of  their  affairs  fell,  in  tho  beginning,  into  the  hands  of  ordinart  lueu—creattlre4  Of  intrigue  and  favour  ;  but  the  whirl  of  events  will  draw  inure  competent  persons  into  action.  If  a  CURSTA,  a  CASTAXOS,  and  a  AlnitlA,  prevented  the  full  efict  of  their  earls  enthusiasm,  the  present  oc‘  currenees,  so  favourable  to  the  bold  Ind  the  entetptising,  are  capable  of  creating  a  PALIFOIC,  in  every  province,  in  every  town.  The  young  and  the  enthusiastic,  in  the  ab absence  sence absence  or  relaxation  of  regular  authority,  will  seize  the  situation  most  conformable  to  their  talents  and  courage.  Nature  has  been  profuse  of  her  choicest  gifts  to  the  people  of  the  Peninsula,  and  the  present  fermentation  of  their  minds  will  excite  a  hardihood  of  thSnking  and  a,  force  of  '  sentiment  which  will  enable  them  to  devise,  as  well  as  execute,  the  boldest  projects.  After  this  view  of  their  character  and  situation,  too  obvious  to  be  mistaken,  we  cannot  conceive  the  instability  of  the  public  opinion  on  their  concerns.  Neither  our  judge  ments  nor  our  hopes  were  the  result  of  reflection,  aud  we  consequently  varied,  every  week,  from  enthusiasm  to  de depression,  pression, depression,  from  extravagance  to  despondency.  Unacquaint Unacquainted  ed Unacquainted  with  the  country,  its  resources  and  peculiarities,  we  created  a  chimerical  people—children  of  our  imagination  *  aud  fashioned  by  our  wishes.  Every  propitious  fairy  was  invited  to  bestow  some  peculiar  mark  of  her  favour  on  the  fondling  ;  and,  in  the  wildness  of  our  predilection,  we  would  conceive  no  modern  Spaniard  but  iu  the  dress  and  qaracter  of  La  Mancha's  hero.  This  extravagance  is  un.  wprthy  of  thinking  mien;  and  if  we  learn  to  appreciate  the.  Spaniards  as  they  really  arc—faithful  to  their  engage.  ments,  constant  in  their  pursuits,  and  with  a  sense  of  honour  bordering,  on  the  romantic,  we  will  cease  to  be  agitated  by  such  aguish  feelings  in  their  behalf,  and  our  esteem  and  support  will  be  more  rational  and  constant.

The  House  adjourned  till  five  o'clock,  when  the  Chancellor  resumed  the  woolsack,  and  his  Majesty's  speech  was  again  read.  The  Earl  of  BRIDGEWATER  rose  to  move  the  Address,  but  spoke  so  inaudibly  that.scarcely  a  sentence  could  be  beard.  His  Lordship  concluded  by  moving  the  Address;  which  as  usual  was  an  echo  of  the  speech.  Lord  SBLFFIELD  seconded  the  Address.  Earl  Sr.  VINcENT  said,  that  the  Address  just  read  was  such,  that  no  man  who  bad  a  veneration  for  his  Sovereign,  or  a  love  for  his  country,  could  ever  assent  to.  Whether  he  took  into  consideration  the  manner  in  ,  which  the  war  was  carried  on  in  Portugal,  or  the  way  in  which  our  troops  had  been  sent  there.  Transports  were  hired,  and  great  merit  was  to  be  attributed  to  the  ingenuity  of  Ministers  in  providing  these  transports.  lie  wished  to  notice  their  important  services,  46 STYLE=superscript  why,  truly,  they  were  at  last  employed  to  convey  the  rascally  ruffians  whom  Junot  commanded  to  that  part  of  France  which  was  nearest  the  boundaries  of  Spain.  So  that  these  devils  are  at  this  moment  harassing  the  rear  of  our  retreating  army.  The  impolicy  of  send sending  ing sending  British  troops  to  Portugal  he  always  disapproved;  but  the  result  of  the  star  there  he  was  disgusted  with.  In  fact,  continued  his  Lordship,  it  would  seem  as  if  Ministers  had  uot  even  a  geo geographic  graphic geographic  knowledge  of  the  country  through  which  they  were  to  pass,  But  their  ignorance  of  that  species  of  knowledge,  one  would  suppose  was  official;  for  a  Heaven-horn  Minis 'Minister,..'  just  after  he  first  came  into  power,  asked  whether  Port  Mahon  was  in  Europe  Of  not;  [we  can  but  barely  suppose  that  his  Lordship  meant  the  late  Mr:  Pitt],  and  the  persons  at  present  in  power  manifested  just  the  same  local  ignorance,  whets  they  sent  an  army  to  traverse  a  wild  and  inhospitable  country,  at  the  very  commencement  of  the  rainy  season,  to  drink  new  wines,  and  to  he  overwhelmed  with  disease  as  well  as  fatigue.  So  little  confidence  did  he  place  in  these  men,  that  he  was  of  the  decided  opinion,  that  unless  they  were  removed,  the  country  41,031  d  be  lost.  The  Convention  of  eintra  could  not  be  considered,  without  feeling  sentiments  of  alarm,  as  well  as  indignation.

At  Vimiera  we  gained  a  victory,  and  in  the  moment  that  our  soldiers  are  flushed  with  conquest,  recourse  is  had  to  a  Council  of.  War;  that,  be  presumed,  could  only  have  beery  necessary,  or  indeed  apologised  for,  in  the  moment  of  defeat.  The  same  opinion  he  entertained  of  the  Enquiry,—it  was  a  shield  to  ward  off  investigation  from  Mi Ministers  nisters Ministers  themselves;  but  he  trusted  that  their  Lordships  would  not  be  prevented  from  making  a  sertipuleas  investigation  of  it  in  their  own  way.  He  knew  the  character  of  the  Portuguese  exceed.  ingly  well;  they,  excepting  the  city.of  Lisbon,  were  as  brava  people  as  any  upon  the  Continent,  and,  officered  with  British  soldiers,  would  have  presented  an  undaunted  front  to  French  . STYLE=superscript  men.  Vhy  was  not  that  expedient  made  use  of?  Ministers  ought  to  have  known  their  value,  and  if  they  did  not,  their  ig ignorance  norance ignorance  was  inexcusable.  If  that  House  did  its  duty,  they  would  immediately  proceed  to  the  foot  of  the  throat,  and  there  tell  the  Sovereign  the  hold  truth,  that  if  he  does  not  remove  them  he  will  lose  the  country.  These  were  the  sentiments  of  his  heart;  he  spoke  them  as  a  solemn  duty,  which  he  found  himself  bound  to  express.  It  wits  probably  the  last  time  be  would  trouble  their  Lordships  on  the  suttject,  and  with  that,  said  the  Noble  Admiral,  I  wish  your  Lordships  good  night.—(At  these  last  words  the  Noble  Earl  instantly  walked  out  of  the  House).  Lord  SIDMOUTM  adverted  to  the  silence  which  the  Speech  observed  with  'respect  to  America.  Their  Lordships  were  calA  led  upon  to  agree  to  an  Address,  approving  of  a  treaty  :  but  be  hoped  that  nothing  so  inconsistent  would  be  imposed  upon  the  House,  there  was  no  treaty  with  Spain  before  them.  The  turn  which  the  war  took  in  Portugal  produced  general  dissa dissatisfaction,  tisfaction, dissatisfaction,  and  ahcwed  that  the  people  nem  would  place  coati.

Ministers,  he  trusted,  would  satisfy-the  House  that  they  did  not  expect  the  disisters  which  have  happened  in  Spain,  and  that  these  disasters  did  tot  happen  from  want  of  foresight.

He  thought  nothing  could  now  justify  the  sending  any  more  British  troops  into  the  interior  of  Spain.  There  was  a  paper  pub pub'shed  'shed pub'shed  In  Spain.  which  in  the  beginning,  signified  both  well  and  wisely  the  species  of  warfare  that  ought  to  be  carried  on  there  as  most  effective  against  French  usurpation.  They  should  reflect,  that  they  are  about  to  send  40,000  to  contend  with  '600,000.  If  they  intend  to  give  important  aid  to  the  Spnniards,  it-  must  be  by  other  expeditions.

Two  months  elapsed  after  the  victory  of  Vimiera,  before  a  single  soldier  Leaves  •  Portugal  for  Spain  ;  and  two  months  more  pass  awe\  before  a  single  British  musket  is  fired  at  the  enemy.  They  ar arrive  rive arrive  as  the  armies  of  Spain  are  overthrown,  her  provinces  over overrun,ther  run,ther overrun,ther  Nobles  murdered,  and  the  tyrant  triumphs.  As  to  the  Armistice  and  Convention,  the  sense  of  the  country  was  so  round roundly  ly roundly  expressed  upon  these  topics,  that  all  he  could  say  respecting  them,.  would  be  but  echoing  the  indignant  sentiment  of  the  whole  nation  ;  all  he  would  add  to  these  expressions  was,  that  ir  Ministersintended  to  meet  the  enemy  in  the  plains  of  Portugal  they  should.  have  sent  out  cavalry  ;  and  if  they  intended  that  we  should  attack  them  in  theirfortifications  '  they  should  have  sent  out  artillery.  „But  they  did  neither  ;  nor  had  our  troops  a  Com Commissariat  missariat Commissariat  even  to  support  them  on  the  sea  coast.  The  decision,  therefore,  'of  the  Board  of  Enquiry  was  right.  But  hew,  11,•  would  ask,:  does  that  correspond  with  the  sentiments  of  disap-  probation-expressed  in•the  Speech,  of  the  terms  of  part  of  that  Convention?

His  Lordship  then  adverted  to  Ametioa.  s-He  signified  in  strong  terms  his  astonishment  that  Ministers  pursued  such  crooked  policy  towards  that  country;  His  Lordship  noticed  a  difference  between  the  language  of  Ministers  in  the  Declaration,  and  that  used  in  the  Speech,  respecting  the.  proposals  from  Brfurth;  and  concluded  with  observing,  that•  if  we-seam  best  officers  and  our  best  troops  to.

It•  - STYLE=superscript  was  the  last  hope.  the  Continent  could  cherish  for  re re'establishing  'establishing re'establishing  its  independence,  and  if  viewed  through  a  more  sel selfish  fish selfish  medium,  and  the  geographical  posit*  of  the  Peninsula  of  tipain.  i  wainttended  to,  it  would  be  found  that  the  possession  of  its  anti*  Franceinvolved  not  only  our  dearest  interests,  but  the  inure:Mate  safety  of  a  part  of  his  Majesty's  dominions.  With  regard•to  site  result  of  the  Pottage'  Expedition,  and  its  opera operations,  tions, operations,  he.  was  prepared  to  say,  that  no  neglect  ons  attributable  to  -Ministers.  But  of  the  Convention  itself,  whether  it  was  wise  or  expedient  to  afford  that  ca-operation  in  the  interior  of  Spain,  be  would  admit,  a  question  might  hereafter  arise,  which  he  and  his  colleagues  were  ready  to  meet.  His  Lordship  next  combated  the  arguments  respecting  America,  and  said  it  was  clear  the  American  Government  bad  not  poised  the  scales  of  justice  equally  between  England  and.  France.  To  the  latter  they  had  said,  if  yon  rescind  your  decree,  we  shall  consider  our-.  selves  at.  war  with  the  other  Belligerent;  but  to  England,  they  had  said,  if.  you  repeal  your  'Orders  in  Council,  we  will  continue  . STYLE=superscript  our  li.mbargo  only  as  to  France.  It  was  the  obvious  policy  that'  England  should  be  at  peace  with  America,  provided  she  could  maintain  it  consistently  with'  the  honour  and  welfare  of  the  na naiiotr  iiotr naiiotr  at  large.

The  moment  it  was  known  in  this  country  that  the  Supreme  Junta  was  established,  Gen.  Baird's  array  was  ordered  out,  and  deputations  sent  to  the  new  Government  to  order  proper  ac accommodation,  commodation, accommodation,  for  the  receptiou  of  our  army  at  Corunna.  It  arrived  at  Corunna  before  the  necessary  ,preparations  had  bee  4  made  to  receive  them,  and  before  the  orders  for  that  purpose  .  had  beep  received  from  the  Supreme  Junta.  This  accounts  for  the  delay  of  the  debarkation,  of  which  so  much  has  been  un unnecessarily  necessarily unnecessarily  said.  With  respect  to  the  delay  of  the  sailing  of  this  armament,  his  Majesty's  Ministers  were  equally  less.  Every  document  on  this  subject  will  be  freely  laid  be before  fore before  the  House,  and  I.  cannot  help  looking  forward  with  plea pleasure  sure pleasure  to  the  period,  when  his  Majesty's  Government  will  have  it  in  its  parser  completely  to  clear  itself.  The  Gentlemen  opposite  have  also  said  much  respecting  the  propriety  of  sending  our  first  armataent  to  Portugal.  From  all  the  militaryopinions  of  any  consequence,  I  um  convinced  that  Horogal  was  the  most  eligi eligible  ble eligible  point  to  tt  Welt  that  armiment  could  be  seat.  Cqnsidering  Por  t  tugal  as  formiog  part  of  the  same  Peninsula  with  Spaith,-  7  thetirsc  necessary  step  was,  to  drive  the  Freuch  from  Portugal,  in  order  to  preserve  the  contineitv  mid  to  keep  up  a  connection  tied  cons-.  munleation  with  the  North  of  Spain.  One  of  the  precautions  which  the  Right  Hon.  Gentleman  says  we  ought  to  have  taken  was  to  have  got  ppsses;ion  ofstune  town,  that  might  have  served  . STYLE=superscript  as  a  depot  and  a  rallying  point,  in  case  of  necessity.  Lisbon  is  exactly  place  of  this  description,  and  therefore,  way,  au  ob object  ject object  highly  deserving  of  being  secured,  and  where  ;  at  this  tno  3  meat  our  troops  live  on  the  must  amicable  terms  with  the  inhas  hitants.  But  the  Bight  lion.  Gentleman  is  alsq  ogeected•that  his  Majesty's  Government  should  enter  into  any  formal  treaty  with  the  Government  of  Spairi.  It  was  generally  understood  before  the  close  of  the  last  session  of  Parliament  that  his  Majesty  had  engaged  to  aid  and  support  the  Paiciots:  Will  it  he  of  no  consequence  to  Jo  , STYLE=superscript  epli  ilonaparte,  'that  we*  should  publicly  recogni*e  the  Spanish  Government,  and  treat  with  it  accordingly  t  The  Right  lion.  secretary  then  adverted;  with  his  usual'ability,  to  the  remarks  that  had  fallen  from  the  ..  other  side  of  the  House  respecting  America.  The  dispute  was,  whether  -  the  French,  in  .their  Berlin  Decree,  were  the  aggressors,  or  this  country  in  their  blockade  of  the  Conti.  tient,  from  the  Elbe  so  the  Weser,  a  blockade  which  the  say  was  against  the  common  usages  of  war,  as  it  was  not  sustained  by  a  legitimate  force,  and  therefore,  warranted  their  Berlin  Decree  as  a  measure  of  retaliation  st  wbereaS  we  said  it  wee STYLE=superscript  tamed  by  a  legitimate  Nrce  equal  to  the  extentofblockade.  Awe%  rica  had  Maintained  that  she  had  not  had  time  to  apply  to  France  for  redress.  We  gave  notice  to  her  Ambassador  in  London,  and  in  a  week  after,  in  the  beginning  of  January,  4410  toe  Orders  of  Council.  It  was  matter  of  notorious  fort,  however,  he  maintained,  that  the  American  Embargo  was  not  the  consequence  of  the  Orders  of  Council,  which  were  not  loown  in  America  when  the  embargo  was  laid  on.  HA  observed  farther,  that  at  the  moment  America  was  making  the  propositioss  alluded  to  this  country,  she  admitted  French  ships  of  war  into  her  ports,  a  privilege  she  persistNl  in  denying  to  Had  this  Government  acceded  to  her  propositiowz,  therefore,  our  merchantmen  would  have  heeu  obliged  to  trade  in.her  ports  without  the  protection  of  British  convos,  and  exposed  to  be  captured  by  the.  French  ships  of  war,  •  The  American  coast  would  in  this  .Case  have  become  rt  vest  of  privateers,  and  have  prevented  any  beneficial  ee(mlts  to  this  country  from  its  concessions..  The  French  and  wA  were  nnt  on  an  equal  footing  with  America,.  Let  her  exclude  the  ships  of  war  of  both  itowert  equally  from  her  ports,and  then  this  country  might  treat  with  her  on  honourable  terms;  but,  in  the  present  circumstances,  he  could  not.  consider  her  as  a  fair  and•  impartial  Neutral  Power.  With  respect  to  the  silence  of  his  Majesty's  Speech  respecting  our  relations  with  Turkey,  he  had  •  to  acquaint  the  I  ouse  that  Government  had  not  beard  from  Mr.  Adair,  our  late  M  inister  in  that  quarter,  since  he  left  Malta  the  beginning_of  44-!l  , STYLE=superscript  tember  last.

Benevente  has•  been  burnt,  and  the  French  threaten  Astorga  with  the  same  fate.

The  staff  equipage  of  the  English  arrived  here  on  the  7th,  but  the  head  quarters  of  that  army  are  still  at  Lugo.  On  the  aftentonn  of  the  tith,  the  enemy  made  a  paitial  'attack  no  tbe  English  position.  but  were  repuked  with  the  lOss  pfi  sooabout  men  ;  that  of  the  English  being  but.  trifing.

We  have  grounds,  how howpier,  pier, howpier,  for  disbelieving  the  authenticity  of  this  statement`  because  we  have  authority  for  stating  that  no  such  event  was  known  on  the  4th  inst.  at  Cadiz.  On  the  contrary,  the  opinion  was  prevalent  there  at  that  time,  that  Barcelona  was  on  the  point  .  of  surrendering  ;  and  that  the  enemy  were  not  in  competent  force  in  Catalonia  to  contend  with  -24..'&#34;Jhe  Patriots.

The  disposition  tif:the  people'  is  turning  strongly  in  favour  of  this  ii•opo*AL,  and  the  circumstances  of  the  times  are  equally  aus auspicious.  picious. auspicious.  Evangelical  hearers  begin  decidedly  to  prefer  far  their  preachers,  if  •  possessed  of  talents,  those  who  have  been  trained  in  the  universities  of  their  country  ;  partly  supposing  them  more  respectable  characters  as  gentlemen,  and  partly  because  the  diffused  -  intelligence  of  the  age,  owing  to  the  liberalised  system  of  education  now  . STYLE=superscript  •predo •predominant,  minant, •predominant,  inspires  the  rising  generation  with  disgust  for  tha  ignorance  and  elfrordery  of  self-taught  religious  pastors.  Aware  of  this  commencing  revolution  in  the  minds  of  their  congregations,  the  evangelical  preachers  are  sedulonsly  adapting  themselves  to  the  new  situation  in  which  they  are  constrained  to  appear,  and  studying  the  character  it  will  be  necessary  for-  them  to  assume.  If  they  are  supinely  suf suffered  fered suffered  to  establish  themselves  in  intelligence,.  and  conciliate  the  confidence  of  their  new  order  of  hearers,  the  vratest  is  •,-'.  decided.  Some  sentences,  which  fell  from  the  Rev.  SAMUEL  CROWTHER,  last  Sunday  morning,  suggested  to  IPC  the  propriety,  if,  not  necessity,  of  again  adverting  to  the  question  of  popular  preaching,  as  it  respectively  -con -concerned  cerned -concerned  the  evangelicalians  and  the  establishment.  I  can cannot  not cannot  agree  in  thinking,  with  the  present  excellent  Preacher,.  that  the  thinness  of  the  congregations,  .attend .attending  ing .attending  our  national  churches  and  chapels  is  to  be  attributed  to  the  iedifference  of  the  people  towards  divine  worship,  Hoilesty  becomes  the  pulpit  on  all  occasions.  Let  us  ba balance  lance balance  the  ma!ter  candidly  ;  and,  since  we  must  try  it  in  the  balance  of  the  sanctuary,  while  we  are  loading  cue  ,cale  with  t!;e  inthlierence  of  hearers,  let  us  nut  omit  to  th,'ew  the  idahPilN  preaehers  into  its  opposite.  Mr.  Crow  thug's  experievec  contradicts  his  own  conclusion.  Re,  ‘t  no  is  aft  able  prea.7her,  always  preaches  to  attentive,  and  often  nu numerens,  merens, numerens,  hearers.  It  is  not  for  him  to  complain  either  of  vacated  pews  or  unattentive  hearers.  Mr.  Crowther.  accomplished  his  preparatory  studies  at  Winchester,  whence  he  was  sent,  on  the  Foundation  Pre Presentation  sentation Presentation  of  that  celebrated  seminary,  to  New  College,  Oxford.  After  being  tome  years  Curate  of  Barking  in  Essex,  he  was  induced  to  place  himself  in  nomination  for  the  church  in  which  he  now  principally  officiates.  Ho  found,  however,  a  competitor  for  the  vacant  pastorship,  iu  no  less  formidable  an  opponent,  whether  cwsideri.al  as  to  pretensions  Or  interest,  than  the  respectable  Mager  of  the  Eltie-coat-Sehool.  So  powerful,  nevertheless,  were  the  spontaneous  testimonials  pres  , STYLE=superscript  :!:ited  from  the  people  among  whom  be  had  till  then  ininistred,  and  so  decisive  was  the  evidence  of  his  public  ability,  that  Mr.  Crowther  was  im immediately  mediately immediately  chosen  to  be  the  new  Vicar  of  Christ's  Church.  He  is  .  also  ,Aitmtate  Afternoo:Aecturer  of  Bishopsgate.  He  has,  I  think,  printed  one  or  tw=o  single  Sermons  ;  hut,  as  I  never  met  with  them,  it  would  not  become  me  to  pretend  to  characterise  theni.  •  Some  admirers  of  extemporary  preaching  would  be  dis disposed  posed disposed  to  undervalue  the  exertions  of  Mr.  Crowther.  His  sermons  are  always  recomposed  ;  and,  he  reads  so  atten attentively,  tively, attentively,  as  not  sufficiently  to  look  at  his  auditors.  His  voice  wants  variety  ;  nor  car  he  be  jeAly  .represented  as  dis displaying  playing displaying  the  advantages  of  unembarrassed  action  in  tiie  pulpit.  While,  however,  such  are  the  deficiencies  observable  in  this  Preacher,  they  are  most  amply  counterbalanced  by  the  the  real  and  numerotm  excellencies  NI  hick  he  noirertnPy  •  uispys.  .
