0002,"THE  NATIONAL  REGISTER,  18  head  the  disapprobation  was  general.  Nevertheless,  with  the  exception  of  one  distinguished  officer,  who  has,  for  the  future,  the  justest  claim  to  the  esteem  and  confidence  of  his  Country  and  Sovereign,  all  the  Members  of  the  Board  have  approved  of  the  _Armistice.  This  is  a  most  extraor extraordinary  dinary extraordinary  circumstance  !  and,  when  contrasted  with  the  uni universal  versal universal  abhorrence  it  excited  in  Portugal,  Spain,  and  Great  Britain,  we  can  account  for  it  in  no  other  manner,  than  that  of  fellow-feeling.  on  the  part  of  those  who  approved.  Opinion  is  almost  every  thing,  in  war.  That  of  the  con continent  tinent continent  in  favour  of  our  military  superiority  and  discipline  had  considerably  abated  since  the  conclusion  of  the  campaign  of  1793.  Some  uufortunate  Expeditions,  since  that  time,  did  not  contribute  to  dispel  this  prepossession  ;  and  the  brav bravest  est bravest  army  upon  earth  sank  low  iu  the  estimation  of  Europe.  ,  This  was  a  subject  of  equal  indignation  and  regret  to  those  `•  who  were•  acquainted  with  our  army  ;  and,  whilst  every  part  of  the  Continent  resounded  with-the  crash  of  Thrones,  or  writhed  under  the  scorpion  lash  of  the  most  abomiaable  I.vrant,  our  assistance,  always  successfully  invoked  by  the  weak  and  oppressed,  was  declined  as  useless.  We  were  the  only  people  capable  and  wilting  to  stop  the  alarming  evil;  and,  the  descendants  of  those  very  men,  who  opposed  a  bar  to  the  overwhelming  ambition  of  Pnittr  11.  and,  who  arrested  LEWIS  XIV.  in  t  h  e  tide  of  his  fortunes  and  the  torrent  of  his  conquest,  were  considered  to  have  so  -  much  degenerated  - STYLE=superscript  from  the  spirit  of  their  forefathers,  that  their  interference,  in  a  much  more  alarming  period  than  either  of  the  above-mentioned,  was  rejected  and  scorned.  This  deplorable  misunderstanding  sealed  the  doom  of  European  independence  ;  and  the  detestable  people  and  their  ruffian  chieftains,  who  waded  in  the  blood  of  nations,  and  gorged  in  their  plunder,  exhausted  abuse,  raisrepre•  sentatioli  and  intrigue,  to  keep  up  the  fatal  prejudice.  Our  own  Government  seemed,  for  a  time,  to  have  imbibed  monething  of  the  delusion;  and,  whilst  Austria  was  strug struggling,  gling, struggling,  in  the  apparently  last  stage  of  her  existence  ;  whilst  Prussia,  Naples,  Portugal,  llP.nover,  Ilesse  Cassel,  and  Brunswick,  were  making  desperate  efforts  to  av  , STYLE=superscript  :rt  the  impending  destruction,  the  British  people,  whose  voice  and  sword  had  formerly  so  much  weight  in  the  transactions  of  Europe,  stood  aloof,  and  were  restrained  from  taking  a  part  in  the  mighty  conflict.  Such  as  felt  the  injustice,  and  were  sensible  to  the  dis disadvantages  advantages disadvantages  of  the  erroneous  opinion  entertained  of  our  army,  ardently  wished  an  opportunity  might  offer,  when  our  soldiers  could  recover  their  ancient  reputation.  It  came,  auspicious  as  Fortune  could  give  or  patriotism  wish  :  and,  whilst  the  feelings  of  the  country  came  in  aid  of  the  combinations  of  policy,  a  British  army  was  transported  to  the  continent  to  secure  this  desideratum  of  the  Statesman  and  Patriot.  Our  army  lauded  in  Portugal,  inferior  to  the  enemy  in  number;  and  the  gallant  officer  who  eom•  tuanded  them,  and  who  proved  himself  so  worthy  of  con.  ducting  British  soldiers,  proceeded  immediately,  though  labouring  under  this  apparent  disadvantage,  to  give  JIINOT  battle.  He  acted  right,  and  in  perfect  conformity  to  the  soundest  principles  of  political  calculation  :  for  it  was  not  sufficient  to  beat  the  enemy—Europe  and  our  allieS  were  to  he  convinced,  that  our  troops  were  superior,  in  every  requisite  of  the  soldier,  to  the  vaunted  legions  of  France.—  The  battle  of  Vitneira  attested  this  superiority  ;  and  we  considered  it,  in  consideration  of  its  consequences,  as  one  Of  the  most  important  occurrences  in  our  history.  The  JAN.  ft  public  at  large  seemed  to  feel  'as  we  did;  every  tongue  was  profuse  of  applause;  and  every  countenance  glistened  with  unspeakable  pleasure,  at  the  first  account  of  this  splendid  victory.  A  defeat  of  11,000  Frenchmen  was  not  capable  of  producing  this  universal  sensation  ;  but,  whilst  our  hearts  had  cause  to  exult,  our  understandings  and  principles  were  satisfied,  that  the  affair  of  Vimiera  was  not  a  useless  scene  of  blood  and  carnage,  it  offered  to  Europe*  certainty  of  emancipation,  might  have  torn  from  its  pedestal  the  Colossus  of  French  preponderance,  destroyed  that  system  of  rapine,  itamorality,  and  carnage,  which  had  prevailed  for  nineteen  years,  and  raised  our  beloved  country  to  the  summit  of  earthly  grandeur  and  happiness.  These  were  the  consequences  the  .public  expected,  and,  had  a  right  to  expect  from  the  victory  of.  Vimiera.  Any  individual,  therefore,  however  high  his  rank,  or  pre-emi pre-eminent  nent pre-eminent  his  former  aervices,  or  distinguished  his  zeal  and.  who,  by  his  incapacity  or  pusillanimity,  marred  these  expectations,  deserves  a  measure  of  censure  propor proportionate  tionate proportionate  to  the  injury  he  has  occasioned.  We  abhor  that thatpolitical  political thatpolitical  indifference  or  faint  heartedness,  which.  is  afraid  or  unwilling  to  offend  private  feelings,  when  the  dearest  interests  of  their  country  require  this  sacrifice.  We  thank  Heaven,  we  are  also  not  without  humanity,  and  feel  as  much  reluctance  as  any  of  our  brethren  to'  contribute  tq  the  distresses  or  afflictions  of  others.  But  shall  we  be  base  enough,  from  motives  of  interest,  weakness  or  fear,  to  be  silent,  or  even  approve,  what  we  know  to  be  a  national  disaster  as  well  as  disgrace,  and  has  already  been  produCtive  of  such  signal  disadvantage  to  our  allies.  We  abhor  and  loudly  disclaim  every  party  feeling  on  the  occasion;  and  eau  boldly  appeal  to  our  readers,  if  a  single  sentiment  ever  appeared  in  the  NATIONA  L  REOISTEZ  t  which  did  not  breather  an  ardent  desire  to  see  the  honour  as  well  as  interests  of  the  country  promoted.  Unwilling,  therefore,  to  have  the  honour  of  our  arms,  or  the  reputation  of  the  country  degraded,  we  abominate,  and  will  never  cease  to  condemn,  every  measure  which  may,  in  the  slightest  sense  of  the  word,  contribute  to  either.  The  public,  in  their  addresses  to  the  Throne,  have  been  unani unanimous  mous unanimous  in  their  condemnation  of  the  Armistice  and  Conven Convention  tion Convention  of  Cintra  on  this  very  principle;  and  the  Sovereign  has  himself  declared,  that  they  disappointed  the  wishes  and  expectations  of  the  country  :  We  trust,  therefore,  that  a  more  competent  tribunal,  than  that  of  the  Board  of  Inquiry,  will  still  examine  the  merits  of  the  Armistice  and  Convention.

TAN.  8.  Ng'twat  History.--There  is  9.  heautiful  little  hawk,  generally  called  a  sparrow-hawk,  but  which,  in  fact,  is  of  a  very  different  species,  being  a  kestrel  or  windhover  (Falca  Tinnuneulus)  now  living,  belonging  to  Mr.  John  King,  of  Buckingham,  which  fre frequently  quently frequently  takes  its  flight,  and  is  absent  fur  several  da  i  s,  a  week  or  two,  or  longer;  when  it  returns  to  the  house,  and  goes  about  as  tamely  as  before.  It  was  taken  from  its  nest,  when  very  young,  in  Jane  1807,  and  bred  up  tame.  Mice  arc  its  favourite  food.  Within  the  last  two  months,  it  has  changed  its  old  plumage  for  a  new  and  much  brighter  one,  being  chiefly  of  a,brick-coloured  red,  embellished  with  elegant  black  tr  i  angu  lar  spots.  A  more  affecting  case  than  the  following  has  seldom  occurred.  The  wife  of  Mr.  Middleton,  a  farmer  at  Winmour,  near  Hesler Heslerton,  ton, Heslerton,  upon  the  Wolds,  in  Yorkshire,  with  her  infant  child,  her  sister,  and  the  housekeeper,  had  been  at  a  farm-house  of  Mr.  Middleton's,  at  some  little•  distance,  and  set  out  on  their  return  home  in  the  afternoon  of  Saturday  se'•nnight.  Two  men  belong— belonging  ing belonging  to  the  farm  had  been  with  Mr.  Middleton  afterwards,  and  told  him  of  the  party  having  left  the  farm,  hut  supposed,  as  the  day  was  stormy,  they  must  have  returned,  with  an  intention  of  stopping  there  for  the  night.  Should  this  not  prove  to  be  the  case,  the  men  proposed  to  go  bark  immediately  to  Mr.  Middle,  ton,  and  inform  him  of  it.  Not  hearing  any  thing  from  them-  Mr.  Middleton  supposed  the  party  'had  returned  and  were  safe.  About  ten  o'clock  at  night,  however,  as  he  was  going  to  look  after  some  sheep  near  the  house,  his'foot  struck  against  some something,  thing, something,  which,  on  examination,  proved  to  be  the  body  of  a  dead  child  ;  and  his  astonishment  and  affliction  may  be  more  easily  conceived  than  expressed,  when  he  found  it  to  be  his  own  and  only  daughter.  On  making  further  search  immediately,  his  wife  and  housekeeper,  and  his  wife's  sister,  were  found  at  a  short  distance,  nearly  lifeless;  the  two  former  are  recovering,  but  his  sister  had  lost  the  use  of  her  limbs,  and  little  hopes  are  entertain entertained  ed entertained  of  her  regaining  the  use  of  them.

The  very  circumstance  of  their  having  been  chosen  by  the  Juntas  of  two  provinces,  which  have  displayed  such  zeal  and  enthusiasm  in  the  cause,  is  a  presumPtive  proof  that  they  arc  men  of  no  common  character,  and  entitle  them  to  the  honour  of  being  cordially  hated  by  the  detestable  tyrant.

I  am  far  from  wishing  to  discourage  thi3  salutary  species  of  reflection',  if  it  be  equitably  exerted.  Surely,  however,  it  is  neither  wise  or  kind  to  contemplate  chiefly  the  gloomy  aspect  of  affairs  ;  to  call  to  mind  only  the  miseries  we  have  experienced  or  the  judgments  we  have  deserved,  and  to  anticipate  future  disasters  and  punish punishments.  ments. punishments.

Such  is  the  language  of  one,  who  nobly  exemplified  in  himself  the  inestimable  advantages  derivable  from  genuine.  religious  devotion.  I  come  now  to  speak  of  the  Divine  *hose  clerical  character  remains  to  be  investigated.  The  REV.  ROBERT  HODGSON  is  one  of  the  nephews  of  Mrs.  Porteous,  formerly  Miss  Hodgson,  the  respected  Lady  of  the  present  venerable  Bishop  of  London.  Be  is  from  Benet  College,  in  the  University  of  Cambridge.  Mr.  Hodgson  has  published  two  sermons;  one  preached  before  the  Corporation  of  the  Sons  of  the  Clergy,  and  another  ou  the  re-opening  of  St.  George's  Church,  of  which  he  is  now  the  Rector,  after  its  having  undergone  repairs.  He  owes  his  present  ecclesiastical  preferment  to  the  patronage  of  his  uncle.  Mr.  Hodgson  is  married,  and  has  several  chil children.  dren. children.  As,  however,  he  is  still  young  in  the  pulpit,  I  must  not  shrink  from  the  duty  of  explicitly  stating.  my  opinions  respecting  his  clerical  conduct  and  character.  While  there  is  room  for  improvement  in  his  preaching,  there  is  also  time  *for  him  to  effect  improvement.  His  person,  though  not  striking,  is  sufficiently  respect respectable.  able. respectable.

Here,  it  is  far  from  gratifying  to  me  to  remark,  the  previous  conceptions  entertained  of  his  excellence  become  suddenly  and  painfully  disappointed.

His  voice  is  doubtless  manly;  but  he  forces  it  beyond  its  pro proper  per proper  pitch,  while  his  falling  tones  sink  infinitely  below  its  general  scope.  Respecting  his  style  of  composition,  I  cannot  do  better  than  refer  Mr.  Hodgson  to  the  judicious  hint  given  on  this  P12_TB00024 • ",0002644/1809//0108/0002644_18090108_mets.xml

Action,  like  oratory,  is  best  when  it  is  least  artificial.  Mr.  Hodgson's  action  seems  too  careful  to  be  sufficiently  usual.  It  is  not  altogether  uninteresting,  it  is  sometimes  emphatic  ;  yet  he  has  the  awkwardness  of  mostly  holding  his  sermon-case  with  both  his  hands,  and  continually  bob bobbing  bing bobbing  it  up  and  down,  from  oft  and  on  his  cushion.  1k  also  extends  his  left,  too  much  in  preference  of  his  right,  hand.  When  most  animated,  he  has,  owing  to  the  suddenness  of  his  transitions  from  one  side  of  the  plipit  to  the  other,  the  appearance  of  bustling.  Notwithstanding  the  measured,  and  not  undignified  solemnity,  of  his  enunciation,  there  is  •  something  hurried  throughout  his  delivery.  Either  his  Sermons  are  frequently  too  long,  or  he  is  uni uniformly  formly uniformly  too  slow  in  preaching  them.  His  illustrations  might  be  rendered  more  pertinent  and  conclusive.  He  does  not  satisfactorily  explain  the  purport  of  his  positions,  nor  does  he  properly  avail  himself  of  the  divinity  by  which  they  are  sanctioned.  Aware  as  he  mnst'be  of  the  fanatical  application  of  religious  doctrines,  I  was  rather  surpris4d  to  hear  Mr.  Hodgson  exhorting  the  poor  to  look  up  to  God  only  for  the  supply  of  their  most  urgent  Wants,  without  duly  cautioning  them,  at  the  same  time,  against  .  suWering  themselves  to  repose  in  an  improvident  dependence  on  the  Divine  Providence  ;  to  which  they  so  often  too  6talfy,  though  devoutly,  abandon  themselves.  Hanover-Square,  it  might  have  been  supposed,  was  far  enough  from  the  neighborhood  of  the  Bank  of  Faith.  Mr.  Hodgson  is,  after  all,  an  esteemed  preacher  ;  and  many  of  the  defects  which  he  betrays  partly  originate,  1  am  persuaded,  in  his  over-anxious  endeavours  to  be  greatly  eminent.  His  public  labours  arc  not  only  acceptable  to  his  parishioners,  but  continue  to  attract  the  attendance  of  strangers  also.  Since,  however,  he  does  not  regularly  occupy  his  own  pulpit,  it  behoves  him  seriously  to  attend  to  the  business  of  ecclesiastical  substitutiou  t  Those  who  are  most  entitled  to  his  presence  ought  not  to  be  the  greatest  sufferers  by  his  absence.  •  Whenever,.  therefore,.  he  is  prevented  from  personally  discharging  his.frigH  duty  as  a  parish  priest,  let  him  sedulously  dele,,  ,, STYLE=superscript  atz,  like  a  popular  preacher  in  his  stead.

After  a  miner  and  actres  s  of  suc  h  exce  ll  ence  as  eatalani,  the  task  was  uncommonly  arduous,  auttderaanded  po  small  degree  of  indulgence  from  the  public.  Madame  Collini  seemed  to  feel  the  difficulty  she  had  to  encounter,  and  her  manners  powerfully  influenced  the  spectators  in  her  favour.  This  first  itnpressioa  was  soon  ripened  into  favour,  for  she  displayed  very  superior  powers  both  of  Voice  and  action.  In  her  features  she  resembles  the  cap captivating  tivating captivating  Grassini,  and  her  tune  is  also  of  the  same  quality.  She  sung  with  ease,  clearness,  and  taste.  The  music  is  a  promising  specimen  of  the  master,  and  was  very  much  ap applauded.  plauded. applauded.  Naldi  was  received  with  the  warm  welcome  which  he  deserves;  for  his  comedy  is  a  high  treat  to  the  Connoisseur.

Young  Vcstris  sprung  forward  with  all  the  power  and  activity  which  his  father  possessed  seventeen  years  ago;  and  the  same  astonishing  talent  seemed  to  be  revived  and  identified.  We  have  no  doubt  but  that  his  performance.  will  excite  the  same  furor.  It  is  really  won wonderful.  derful. wonderful.  The  force,  truth,  and  neatness  with  which  he  performs  his  movements  exceed  any  thing  that  we  have  seen  since  the  day  of  his  father—for  Des  Hayes  is  a  per performer  former performer  of  another  class.  The  graceful  attitude  and  air  of  the  one,  with  the  wonderful  execution  of  the  other,  will  compose  a  picture  perfect  in  its  kind.  The  house  was  in  a  paroxism  of  vociferation  in  the  pa:  de  deux  of  Vestris  and  his  partucr,  Mademoiselle  Angiolini.  She  is  extremely  elegant  in  her  figure,  petite,  but  finely  formed  ;  and  she  has  acquired  the  manner  of  Vestris.  Her  equilibrium  is  perfect.  She  •finishes  the  most  difficult  movement  with  truth  ;  and  her  posture  has  great  strength.  •  Certainly  since  the  first  year  of  Des  Hayes,  when  he  -had  also  Didelot  and  Rose,  we  have  had  no  such  Corps  de  Ballet  in  regard  to  riucipals  as  were  exhibited  last  night.  31  There  being  no  person  in  London  to  identify  him,  and  of  course  no  one  to  charge  him  with  felony  upon  oath,  he  could  not  be  committed  to  prison.  He  was,  therefore,  locked  up  In  a,  strongroom  in  the  Brown  Bear  publicAhnse,  lu  Bow-street.  —  Yesterday  morning,  he  said  he  Wanted  to  go  into  the  yard,  when  a  man,  the  servant  of  Mr.  Mazard,  the  landlord,  attended  him  as  usual.  When  be  was  about  to  return  Into  the  house  again,  he  suddenly  knocked  his  attendant  dawn,  and,  in  consequence  of  some  paling  which  separated  that  yard  from  the  butcher's,  the  house  adjoining,  there  was  a  free  and  uninterrupted  access  to  a  large  space  of  wattle  ground,  at  the  back-of  Russell-street.  w  hick  leads  into  a  narrow  court  in  Russell-street,  through  which  he  made  his  escape.  The  hue  and  cry  of  Stop  was  raised,  and  several  men  ran  in  ail  directions,  but  in  vain.

The  landlord,  after  the  company  had  retired,  and  his  whole  family  had  gone  to  bed,  felt  a  strong  burning  smell.

On  bursting  open  the  door,  he  saw  the  bed  in  flames,  tt  hilst  the  boy  was  found  asleep  in  it.  With  great  exertions  he  succeeded  in  confining  the  flames  to  that  roots  only.  The  hay's  clothes  were  burnt,  but  himself  escaped.  The  tire  originated  from  the  unpardonable  practice  of  sticking  tite  candle  on  one  of  the  posts,  apd  the  boy's  falling  asleep  without  extinguishing  it.

We  were  introduced  to  imany  characters  it  is  true,  but  strongly  suspected,  and,  in indeed,  deed, indeed,  were  convinced  that  we  had  had  some  m  o STYLE=superscript  limpses  of  them  before  on  the  stage;  except,  perhaps,  of  that  which  Johnstone  admirably  represented—an  honest  attorney,  who  assumes  the  appearance  of  a  rascal.  But  this  is  not,  we  much  fear,  a  copy  from  nature,  it  is  a  stretch  of  the  imagination  rather  than  the  result  of  observation.  It  'hews  men  as  they  ought  to  be  (dropping  the  appearance  of  rascality)  and  not,  unfortunately  as  they  ate.  There  is,  perhaps,  some  novelty  too,  in  giving  the  attorney  a  think thinktnr,  tnr, thinktnr,  clerk  ;  but  as  notwithstanding  his  reflecting  powers  and  disposition,  he  still  remains  a  faithful  echo  to  his  mas masters  ters masters  sentiments  and  a  slave  to  his  will,  even  when  it  ap appears  pears appears  evil,  nature  may  be  said  to  have  been  followed  more  closely  than  in  the  delineation  of  the  character  of  the  ho honest  nest honest  Hibernian  Cornelius  O'Detlimus.  The  plot  is  iuteresting,  but  contains  many  incidents  ga gathered  thered gathered  from  ancient  and  modern  plays.  They  arc,  however,  so  artfully  disposed  as  to  wear  the  appearance  of  novelty,  although  it  cannot  boast  its  reality.  They  arc  like  views  of  spots  well  known  to  us,  and  which  though  par partially  tially partially  disguised  by  the  introduction  of  a  tree,  or  the  omis omission  sion omission  of  some  of  their  less  important  features,  cannot  fail  to.  l  strike  oar  recollection,  whenever  we  bestow  an  observing  glance  upon  them.  The  explanation  of  the  may  be  found  in  many  novels,  yet  it  is  not  too  easily  anti anticipated;  cipated; anticipated;  as  our  expectation  of  novelty  hinders  us  from  m STYLE=superscript  hinking  our  surmises  can  be  right.  A  good  natured,  and,  at  times,  passionate  husband,  and  a  nervous,  but  artful  wife,  a  strict  economist.  and  a  household  tyrant,  form,  not  the  first  characters  of  the  comedy,  but  those  to  which  it  owes  its  name.  We  will  now  unfold  some  of  the  chief  incidents  of  the  piece.  In  it  we  find  a  young  and  innocent  girl,  not  unlike  Ms 'Ms.?'  in  John  Bull,  seduced  by  a  rich  lover,  who,  however,  marries  her  secretly,  with  the  intention  of  deceiving  her  by  .employing  a  false  priest  and  treacherous  witnesses  :  but  whose  designs  are  frustrated,  by  the  honesty  of  his  attor attor..ney,  ..ney, attor..ney,  who  provides  a  real  priest.  We  see  the  same  titled  -laver  pay  his  addresses  to  Ellen,  a  baronet's  daughter,  a  'tick  heiress  of  twelve  thousand  a  year,  whose  affections  •are  placed  on  his  cousin,  a  sailor,  who  through  love  for for-sakes  -sakes for-sakes  his  ship  to  visit  his  niistress.  On  hearing  of  ber  ap approaxhing  proaxhing approaxhing  marriage  with  Lord  Austincourt,  he  'steals  into  her  house  to  reproach  her  for  her  unfaithfulness.  '  —Here,  a  quarrel  similar  to  that  of  Donna  nolante,  and  in  The  ensues  between  the  jealous  irri irri.tated  .tated irri.tated  lover,  and  his  wrongly  suspected  mistress,  who  re re•tiresiiia  •tiresiiia re•tiresiiia  anger.  In  asi.bsequent  meeting  she  conceals  bim  in  her  music  room  on  hearing  her  fathers  voice,  and  the  wise  parent  !ravine  learnt  that  the  sailor  was  lurking  near  his  mansion  to  see  her,  locks  her  up  unconsciously  with  him  and  her  maid.  His  friend,  Mr.  Faulkener,  long  thought  dead  but  who  had  lived  for  many  years  disguised  in  the  neigh neigh'bourbood  'bourbood neigh'bourbood  with  an  only  /laughter,  now  calls  upon  him,  ad advises  vises advises  him  not  to  marry  his  Ellen  to  Lord  Aatincoirt,  and  is  on  the  point  of  retiring,  when  the  Baronet,  desirous  to  present  him  to  his  child,  unlocks  the  door,  and  finds  her  in.,  sotripaoy  Clarks.  dustincourt,  the  rolookted  sailor.  JAN:  —A  scene  of  confusion,  and  conjugal  itri&amp;  ensiles  between  the  Baronet  and  his  lady,  who  accuses  him  of  having  wile  liegly  introduced  the  young  adventures'  into  the  hots&amp;  From  thence  we  are  transported  to  the  Attorney's  where  we  learn  that  Charles  austineoures  father  being  left  guardian  to  fiord  Auslinconri,  had  ventured  14,000/i  of  hia  money  in  a  commercial  concern  which  had  failed,  Lord  .4.  who  wished  to  bribe  his  victiin,  and  her  father  into  silence,  with  that  sum,  requests  its  reimbursement,  as  it  had  been  expended  without  his  knowledge.  His  guardian  implbres  his  mercy,  but  his  suit  is  rejected  with  scorn,  which  awakens  the  sluraberiag  powers  of  conscience,  and  he  then  declares  before  .Fanlkener,  who  had  in  vain  required  he  should  wed  his  seduced  daughter,  Ellen  and  her  father,  her  mother-in-law,  and  the  Attorney,  that  having  a  son  of  the  same  age  as  Lord  auslineuort  when  he  became  his  ward,  he  had  yierded  to  the  impulse  of  ambition,  and  IlUbstituteid  his  owu  son  instead  of  the  right  heir,  who  till  then  had  ap appeared  peared appeared  under  the  name  of  (harks  Auslincourt.  'Cornelitit  O'bedinuss  then  informs  the  company  that  the  person  who  had  married  the  no  longer  Lord  A.  and  Faulleener  was  a  real  Priest,  acknowledges  himself  fur  a  witness,  as  well  as  his  clerk,  and  leads  her  in  triumphant  to  the  arms  of  her  husband,  who  suddenly  repents,  and  takes  her  to  his  ho.  som.  The  real  Lord  .lustincourt,  of  course,  obtains  the  hand  of  his  Ellen,  without  any  further  difficulty,  and  thsi  piece  closes.  •  The  dialogue  of  this  comedy  is  highly  commendable  fa  its  purity  both  of  meaning  and  style.  It  does  not  sparkle  with  ban  mots;  it  is  not  grossly  familiar;  it  is  easy  and  elegant,  frequently  energetic,  and  enriched  with  just  hnlt  pleasing  imagery.  Nor  is  it  totally  devoid  of  wit,  though  it  is  completely  free  from  the  affectation  of  it.  The  chit•  racters,  though  not  new,  are  well  delineated,  and  hatipili  contrasted.  The  plot  is  well  conducted,  though  the  two  first  acts  are  rather  laorptid  ;  and  its  greatest  defect  is  its  . STYLE=superscript  length.  Some  of  the  situations  are  well  imag  ined,  many  scenes  highly  comic,  and  some  th  o  ugh  path  etic,  not  too  much  so  for  a  comedy.  Encouraged  by  redoubled  peals  of  epplause,  ail  the  Performers  displayed  the  wh  o  l  e  ext  en  t  of  - STYLE=superscript  their  abilitlea.  Mrs.  Jordan,  in  the  part  of  Ellen,  looked'better  thani  she  has  done  for  many  years;  her  vivacity  was  as  natural  and  as  graceful  'as  ever.  Mrs.  H.  Siddons,  In  the  garb  of  deceived'  innocence,  united  beauty,  modesty  and  sim.  plicity,  with  an  energy  and  justness  of  action  which  .  made  her  performance  truly  delightful.  Dowton  and  Mrs.  Harlowe,  as  man  and  wife,  were  excellent.—  Yet  we  thought  once  or  twice  we  perceived  Dowtoei  &amp;attires  courting  the  approbation  of  the  galleries.  This  happened  in  the  scene  in  which  he  attempts  to  master  his  wife,  and  as  it  is  the  fr.rst  symptom  of  earicatutimanid  which  we  have  ever  observed  in  him,  we  hasten  to  inform  him  of  his  danger,  in  order  that  he  may  guard  pgainst  its  farther  advance.

Johnstone,  in  Corodius  O  a STYLE=superscript  Dedintus,  came  up  to  himself  in  Dennis  Brulgruderry.  Mathews,  as  the  pondering  clerk,  raised  his  part  in  the  comedy  to  a  higher  station  than  it  else  would  have  occupied;  and  Messrs.  Wroughton,  Holland,  and  Powell,  in  Faulkener,  Lord  Auithecourt,  and  his  guardian,  attained  unusual  excellence.  The  epilogue  entertained  us  with  the  keetmesq,  not  the  length  of  an  author's  ear.  It  contained  nothing  re remarkable,  markable, remarkable,  and  the  plaudits  which  it  obtained,  were  de.  served  by  Mr+.  Jordan  who  spoke  it.
