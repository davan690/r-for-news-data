0002,"SUNDAY,  JANUARY  It  9,  1809.  POLITICAL  DISQUISITION.  NDMEER  Fl  FT  Y-SI  X!  --w•--  TO  WHAT  CAUSE  ARE  olnt  MILITARY  -FAILURES  TO  BE  ATTRIBUTED  ?  Every  engagement  with  the  enemy  afords  an  additional  testimony  of  the  superiority  of  our  troops.  Every  new  expedition  gives  an  alarming  proof  of  some  latent  defect  or  mismanagement,  which  frustrates  the  effects  of  this  su superiority.  periority. superiority.  Were  our  soldiers  less  disciplined,  less  nume  rons  and  intrepid,  and  our  disasters  originate  in  this  cause;  we  might,  console  ourselves  with  the  prospect:of  attaining  hereafter  the  advantages  we  do  not  possess  at  present.  But  as  our  military  are  unrivalled  in  every  quality  which  ren renders  ders renders  such  a  force  effective,  it  is  a  subject  of  equal  surprise  and  disappointment,  as  it  is  worthy  of  the  most  serious  in investigation,  vestigation, investigation,  that,  with  so  large  and  expensive  an  esta establishment,  blishment, establishment,  all  our  expeditions,  for  the  last  fifteen  years,  with  the  exception  of  that  to  Egypt,  have  not  been  pro productive  ductive productive  of  advantages,  equivalent  to  the  pay  of  our  army  for  a  single  day.  When  we  recal,  during  that  interval,  the  battles  of  Alexandria,  Maida,  Vimeira,  and  Corunna,  in  which  our  troops  have  performed  prodigies  of  valour;  and  read  over  the  history  of  the  same  period,  which  is  only  a  ,  are  almost  the  existence  elder,  Fer-  rol,  Buenos-Ayres,  and  in  Spain.  There  is  not  one  among  us,  who  has  not  frequently  at-  .  tempted  to  account  for  this  contradiction.  The  incapacity  of  the  Commanders,  the  weakness  of  the  Ministry,  the  de defects  fects defects  of  oar  military  system,  and  a  variety  of  other  causes  have  been  assigned  to  explain  this  political  phenomenon  ;  remedies  have  been  proposed,  anti  changes  introduced;  but  the  mortifying  inconsistency  continues,  and  every  new  en enterprise  terprise enterprise  renders  it  more  glaring  and  repugnant.  When  an  evil  appears  so  inveterate,  and  alarming  from  its  frequency  and  continuation,  it  may  appear  like  presump presumptiow,  tiow, presumptiow,  to  indulge  even  in  the  hope  of  its  eradication;  or  to  propose  measures  to  that  effect.  Selfishness  might  recom recommend  mend recommend  caution,  and  pusillanimity,  silence;  for  there  is  no  small  degree  of  danger  in  combating  abuses  and  errors  too  favourable  to  the  interests  as  well  as  passions  of  many.  The  fatal  influence,  which  is  capable  of  maintaining  them,  is  likewise  armed  with  the  power  of  molesting  the  reformer  ;  and  the  will  is  not  inferior  to  the  many;  of  ptinishing  him  for  his  interference.  The  whole  shoal  of  contractors,  job jobbers,  bers, jobbers,  commissaries,  and  minions,  who  fatten  in  the  pool  of  army-patronage,  will  join  in  criminating  his  intentions;  and,  sensible  of  their  present  advantages,  resist  every  pro proposal  posal proposal  for  purifying  the  noxious  sink.  As  long  as  they  en enjoy  joy enjoy  their  mistresses,  villas,  cooks,  and  equipages,  their  di digestion  gestion digestion  will  not  he  impeded,  nor  their  tVatifitations  re restrained,  strained, restrained,  in  consequence  of  the  disasters  of  the  country,  or  the  disgrace  of  our  arms.  But  such  of  the  public,  as  are  not  i_diviniihy  ititerest ititerested  ed ititerested  in  supporting  a  system  of  peculation,  begin  to  think  there  are  other  interests  to  be  conseited,  paramount  to  the  gratifications  of  a  minion,  or  the  pretensions  of  a  pr.-  tron.  The  mortification  of  our  former  failures,  joineti  to  the  senseless  profusion  of  blood  and  treasure  during  the  present  campaign,  have  already  caused  a  degree  of  irri'a irri'ation,  tion, irri'ation,  which,  we  trust,  will  not  subside!,  till  the  catae  be  rigidly  investigated  and  removed.  if  we  are  not  dead  to  the  honour  of  the  country,  and  the  increasing  peril  of  otie  situation,  if  experience  can  benefit  us,  or  'misfortune  in instruct,  struct, instruct,  we  will  speedily  and  efficaciously  set  about  the  work  of  reform.  Should  the  present  system  continue,  every  Tear  wil  be  marked  with  a  repetition  of  those  blunders  and  d  -  asters,  which  have  of  late  so  prominently  disti!lcA  ed  our  military  enterprises.  The  advantages  of  onr  tom!  situation,  the  vast  superiority  of  our  nay  v,  and  the  dis distracted  tracted distracted  attention  of  the  etiemy,  have  hitherto  preserved  us  from  their  effects.  But  the  .  fortune  which  has  favoured  us  till  now  may  change  ;  and  the  patriotic  spirit  of  the  country,  the  unrivalled  bravery  of  our  troops,  be  incapa-  We  of  resisting  the  pressure  of  the  unexpected  difficultiett.  If  we  Wish  to  have  our  destinies  placed  on  a  more  solid  basis  than  that  of  chance,  we  must  effect  a  chancre  and  a  radical  one  iu  our  military  department.  Past  disasters,  present  disappointments,  and  the  alarming  prospect  !before  us,  are  sufficient,to  rouse  egotism  and  iodotsatie-to  a  of  our  danger.  One  or  two  facts  convey  more  conviction  to  the  mind,  than  volumes  of  eloquent  declamation.  Was  there  eN  er  ail  army  more  compeleut  for  service,  or  animated  with  a  better  spirit,  than.  that  we  sent  to  Portugal  ?  The  Gene Generals  rals Generals  employed  ou  the  occasion  displayed  a  knowledge  of  their  profession,  combined  with  the  courage  of  a  sold;et,  that  the  only  anxiety  we  felt,  Was  dispelled  ;  and  the  pre pretended  tended pretended  superiority  of  the  enemy  over  us  in  this  u  ie  res respect,  pect, respect,  was  no  longer  admitted.  From  that  moment  we  could  look,  with  confidence,  to  the  most  brilliant  re:vat  from  the  operations  of  our  army.  Soldiers  and  Gene,rds  were  equally  good  ;  and  they  were  going  to  figia  under  the  must  auspicious  circumstances  which  fortune  coast  present,  or  the  man  of  honour  choose.  The  natives,  to  a  man,  were  ardent  in  our  favour.

The  people  of  Portugal,  consequently,  abominated  their  oppressors.  Exclusive  of  the  affection  they  must  have  for  us,  as  the  enemies  of  their  tyrants  ;  our  very  name  recalled  to  their  minds  the  influence  and  tranq►►illity  they  possessed  previous  to  their  subjngatiou.

From  the  picture  we  have  now  sketched,  which,  though  hasty,  may  be  relied  on  as  correct,  who  would  have  the  madness  to  prophecy  the  consequences  of  the  ill-fated  cam campaign  paign campaign  that  ensieid?

It  is  true,  our  army  fulfilled  the  ex expectations  pectations expectations  of  the  public,  and  even  surpassed  them.

Such  was  the  campaign,  and  such  the  intelligence  and  heroism  that  marked  its  progress.

The  Earl  of  LI  v  rts  Moot.  rose  for  the  purpose  of  moving  an  Address  of  Thanks  to  his  Majesty,  for  having  communicated  the  papers  on  the  table.  He  was  not  aware  that  arty  objections  would  be  made  to  the  conduct  of  Ministers,  in  having  received  the  overtures  from  Russia  and  France  in  the  manner  they  did.  His  Majesty's  Ministers,  however,  had  laid  it  down  as  a  prin principle  ciple principle  of  their  government  to  meet  any  fair  proposition  of  toe  enemy,  at  any  period  of  the  war,  with  a  frank  and  ready  answer.  The  relations  that  had  lately  taken  place  be between  tween between  his  Majesty  and  the  Spanish  Government  were  uo  secret  to  France  and  Russia.  His  Majesty  demanded  to  kuow  it  Spain  would  be  admitted  as  a  party.  What  was  the  answer?  Why,  the  loyal  population  of  Spain,  fighting  for  the  legitimate  am amnarchy,  narchy, amnarchy,  the  independence  of  their  country,  and  every  thing  dear  to  man,  are  stigmatised  by  the  odious  epithet  the  Spanish  In 'Insurgents;'  and  all  pretensions,  either  for  them  or  from  them,  to  become  a  party  in  the  negaciatiou,  scoffed  at  and  ridiculed..  Under  these  circumstances,  he  could  not  conceive  there  could  be  any  difference  of  opinion  respecting  the  line  of  policy  which  his  Majesty's  Ministers  ought  to  have  pursued.  They  rejected  the  proffered  negotiation.  His  Lordship  concluded  with  express-  . STYLE=superscript  ing  his  deep  regret  that  the  Emperor  of  Russia  could  have  returned  such  an  answer  as  he  had  to  the  communication  front  our  Government,  and  that  he  should  have  so  far  lent  himself  to  the  passions  and  designs  of  France.  His  Lordship  then  read  the  Address,  towards  the  conclusion  of  which  the  wnrfnest  approba approbation  tion approbation  was  expressed  of  the  conduct  of  Government,  in  basing  re refused  fused refused  to  treat  unless  Spaiu  should  be  admitted  as  a  party  to  the  negot  Lord  t  tt  ISSI  VI  LLE  said,  he  had  before  stated  and  he  would  onw  state  again,  that  peace  was  not  to  be  expected  under  the  circumstances  in  which  that  overture  was  made.  The  posses•  sion  of  Spain  was  of  vita!  importance  to  Bonaparte.  It  was,  perhaps,  the  greatest  interest  for  which  he  bad  ever  contended.  Ile  knew  that  two  months  would  put  Into  his  power  that  country  which  Ministers  wished  to  make  a  subject  of  negotia negotiation„knd  tion„knd negotiation„knd  was  it  then  to  be  expected  that  IP;  would  give  away,  by  a  stroke  of  the  pen,  that  which  remainded  to  he  decided  by  the  force  of  arms  ?  He  did  not  find  fault  with  Ministers  for  not  abandoning  the  cause  of  Spain.  but  for  having  put  themselves  in  a  situation  not  to  be  able  to  negotiate  w  it  bout  bringing  in  Spain.  Lord  Elmo  N.  His  Lorthhip  could  no!  agree  with  the  Noble  I3aron  who  spoke  last,  that  Ministers  should  have  considered  the  Spanish  cause  as  one  of  absolnte  despair  from  the  commence commencement—that  ment—that commencement—that  it  was  a  struggle  which  could  not  possibly  last  above  two  months.  It  was  obvious,  from  the  answer  of  both  France  and  Russia,  that  whatever  peace  might  be  made  between  them  and  England,  d,  Spain  was  to  he  surrendered  to  the  former.  and  he  therefore  thought  the  wisest,  the  most  just,  and  magnanimous  policy  on  the  part  of  England,  was  $o  put  an  end  to  the  negotia negotiation  tion negotiation  as  soon  as  possible.  Viscount  S  wino  UTII  rejoiced  that  there  was  130  sacrifice  which  the  country  would  not  rather  make  than  consent  to  abandon  Spain  to  the  most  foul  usurpation  that  ever  polluted  the  pages  .  a  history.  The  Address  was  carried  nent.  con.  and  the  House  adjonrned.  110UbE  OF  COMMONS.  TUESDAY,  JANUARY  21'.

The  Committee  which  had  been  formerly  appointed,  whereof  Mr.  flanks  was  Chairman,  consisted  of  25  Members,  and  had  been  selected  indiscriminately  froni  both  Ades  of  the  house;  he  wished  to  reduce  the  number  to  15,  but  by  no  means  to  exclude  those  Members  whose  political  opinions  differed  from  those  of  himself  and  of  his  friends.  He,  however,  felt  it  somewhat  invidious  to  mention  the  names  of  such  Mem Members  bers Members  as  should  be  excluded  from  the  Committee.  The  names  he  wished  to  form  the  new  Committee  were  the  following  :  Mr.  Banks,  Mr.  Hawkins  Browie,  Mr.  Leslie,  Lord  Henry  Petty,  Mr.  Henry  Thornton,  Mr.  Grattan  Mr.  Calvert,  Mr.  Dennisilrowne,  Mr.  P.

Mr.  PETER  MOORE  said,  the  establishment  of  the  Com Committee  mittee Committee  had  been  a  mere  farce  to  delude  the  people,  and  its  re.  commendations  had  never  been  attended  to.  In  one  report.  a  suggestion.was  made  relative  to  an  arrangement  with  the  Bank  'of  England  which  would  save  the  country  200,000/.  but  by  its  out  having  been  followed  up,  the  country  was  made  to  make  the  sum  up.  In  another  report  it  was  stated,  that  large  sums  of  ,enouey  bad  passed  through  the  bands  of  a  :‘lr.  Thomas  Steele,  formerly  a  Member  of  that  House,  and  that  he  had  appropri appropriated  ated appropriated  19.1001.  to  his  own  use  from  the  public  money,  yet  no  steps  had  been  taken  to  recover  it,  or  punish  the  delinquent,  as  ougiit  to  have  been  done  by  the  Attorney  Gelieral.  He  said  that  he  .  could  prove  that  large  sums  of  money,  which  were  raised  upon  the  people,  never  came  into  the  Exchequer  at  all,  and  he  pro pro'  ' pro'  mised  to  make  it  a  subject  of  parliamentary  investigation  tin  a  future  occasion.  Lord  HENRY  PET'S  If  said,  that  he  felt  it  his  duty  likewise  to  take  no  part  in  the  Committee.  -  Mr.  C.  LONG  said  to  them  we  were  indebted  for  the.  dimimi  tion  of  the  Bank  charges  on  the  management  of  the  funds  ;  be besides  sides besides  he  could  say,  that  all  the  regulations  recommended  by  the  Committee  had  been  adopted  in  the  Pay  Office;  and  he  had  brought  in  a  Bill  last  Session  for  the  very  purpose  of  enforcing  such  of  their  suggestions  as  required  legislative  interference.  Every  thing  suggested  with  regard  to  that  department  had  been  carried  into  etfect  (Here  111  r.  Moore  asked,  was  Mr.  Steele  prosecuted?)  The  Committee  had  not  recommended  any  such  prosecution,  they  had  only  stated  the  facts;  neither  was  it  his  business  to  prosecute  Mr.  Steele.  He  could  say,  however,  that  the  whole  of  the  money  for  which  Mr.  Steele  was  accountable,  had  been  repaid  with  interest.  Mr.  Cit  env  Ks  , STYLE=superscript  observed,  that  that  Gentleman  had  been  de detected  tected detected  in  the  very  fact  of  helping  himself  to  about  15,000/.  of  the  public  money  ;  and  yet  be  was  still  continued  a  Privy  Coun Counsellor,  sellor, Counsellor,  and  had  a  sinecure  of  &amp;opt  12  to  15001.  a  year.

In  this  awful  and  interesting  state  he  haft  but  one  wish  remaining,  a  wish  which  every  individual  in  the  British  Empire  would  he  most  eager  and  anxious  to  fulfil  ;  it  sans,  that  the  service  he  had  performed  might  be  acknow acknowledged,  ledged, acknowledged,  and  marked  with  the  approbation  of  his  country.  If  he  had  not  been  able  to  accomplish  all  that  was  expected  ;  if  he  was  not  able  to  achieve  the  arduous  task  cif  rescuing  Spain  from  the  Tyrant's  grasp,  the  blame  was  not  his---(ioud  and  incessant  cry  of  hear,  hear,  from  the  Opposition).  Whether  the  extent  the  difficulties  to  he  surmounted,  or  the  manner  in  which  it  was  executed,  were  considered,  his  march  into  Spain  would  ever  rank  as  one  of  the  first  displays  of  military  skill  and  excellent  •  disposition.  It  was  not  for  want  of  transports  that  he  deter determined  mined determined  to  march  into  Spain  by  land,  but  as  best  calculated  for  military  effect.  No  doubt  could  possibly  be  entertained  of  the  propriety  of  this  step,  for  if  the  army  had  been  assembled,  (by  sea)  in  Gallicia,  it  must  have  been  destroyed  to  all  intents  and  purposes,  and  rendered  unfit  for  service,  from  the  barrenness  of  the  country  and  the  want  of  every  necessary  resource.  When  the  junction  had  been  formed  ith  the  other  division  of  the  Bri Britisu  tisu Britisu  force,  Sir  John  Moore  learned  the  fate  of  the  allied  armies  with  w  hich  it  was  intended  he  should  have  co-operated.  He  was  now  convinced  that  it  was  impossible  for  him  to  stand  singly  against  •  the  imruense  power  of  France,  and  relinquishing  every  idea  of  so  fruitless  and  dangerous  a  resolution,  he  determined  to  run  the  risk  of  making  a  powerful  diversion  in  favour  of  the  Spanish  force  in  the  south,  and  taking  the  chalice  of  attack attacking  ing attacking  Soult.  As  far  as  the  first  part  of  this  plan  was  concerned  he  was  eminently  successful.  With  regard  to  the  latter  part  ;  al although  though although  disappointed  in  his  design  of  attacking  the'enemy,  under  Soult,  yet  Providence  gave  him  an  opportunity  of  leaving  to  the  army  an  example  of  the  greatest  military  talents.  At  Cornana,  he  had  at  length  the  satisfaction  of  being  able  to  meet  and  to  defeat  an  enemy  his  superior  in  every  respect  but  in  bravery,  discipline,,  and  determined  resolution.  When  the  movements  of  an  army  are  so  rapid  as  those  of  ours  necessarily  were,  the  retreating  army  are  compelled  to  leave  behind  them  all  those  who  are  too  weak  to  maintain  the  exertions  required  for  the  celerity  of  the  much,  while  the  enemy  on  theother  hand  follows,  with  the  most  strong  and  athletic  of  his  forces.  It  was  thus  not  a  trial  of  courage  but  of  physical  strength.  If,  after  all  this,  an  army  could  completely  defeat,  and  embark  in  the  presence  of  a  superior  force,  which  they  had  heat  the  day  before  ;  if  their  embitrka-,  tion  was  so  complete,  that  net  a  single  wounded  man,  not  a  single  piece  of  artillery,  or  an  article  of  the  capture  of  which  the  enemy  could  boast,  were  left;  it  was  impossible  to  deny,  that  such  an  atehievement  ranked  with-  the  most  glorious  that  ever  adorned  the  British  name.  A  more  splendid  movement  of  combined  naval  and  military  means  never  was  witnessed.  I  t  justified  Government  of  making  use  of  these  two  strong  arms  for  the  salvation  of  the  oppressed  world.  The  Noble  I.ocd  con concluded  cluded concluded  with  maving,  that  an  humble  Address  be  presented  to  his  Majesty,  that  his  Majesty  should  be  graciously  pleased  to  order  a  monument  to  be  erected  in  gratitude  to  the  memory  of  Lieute Lieutenant-General  nant-General Lieutenant-General  Sir  John  Moore,  K.

0021,"TIIE  NATIONAL  REGISTER;  force  to  bear  on  our  army  ;  and  the  glorious  result  of  the  memorable  battle  of  Corunna,  under  all  the  inconveni inconveniences  ences inconveniences  our  soldiers  laboured  under,  will  teach,  at  last,  the  country  and  the  Cabinet,  that  the  idea  of  our  beating  the  French  on  their  own,  or  Spanish,  or  any  ether  ground,  is  not  so  chimerical,  as  has  been  imagined.  Almost  half  '  the  enemy's  force  in  Spain  had  been  detached  against  this  handful  of  ours  ;  and  with  all  their  celerity,  impetuosity,  and  generalship,  they  were  unable  to  prevent  our  retreat;  and,  at  its  termination,  were  signally  defeated.  The  tyrant  himself,  who  iiwnediately  after  his  arrival  on  the  25th  at  the  army,  had  witnessed  the  exploits  of  Our  cavalry,  and  judging  there  were  more  blOws  than  honour  to  be  acquired  in  directing  the  operations  against  the  British  Army,  mean meanly  ly meanly  stole  away  from  the  field  of  honour,  and  confided  to  one  of  his  Subaltern  ruffians  the  dangerous  task  of  driving  it  Sato  the  sea.  He  had,  at  St  Jean  d'Acre,  a  specimen  of  the  laurels  to  be  gained  in  fighting  with  our  soldiers,  and  the  wary,  cunning  and  dastarly  usurper  thought  it  safer  to  compose,  under  the  name  of  Bulletins,  atrocious  libels  against  our  troops,  than  to  fight  them  manfully.  If  this  circumstance  is  not  capable  of  extinguishing  the  admiration  . STYLE=superscript  of  domestic  panegyrists  of  that  usurper,  and  of  rousing  the  confidence  and  energy  of  Ministers  ;  we  will  only  say  the  inveterate  stupidity  of  the  one  is  incurable;  and  that  the  latter  are  incompetent  to  administer  the  affairs  of  this  country.  The  base  detractors  of  our  co-ope co-operation  ration co-operation  in  support  of  continental  independence  are  silenced,  for  ever,  by  the  victory  at  Corunna;  and  the  public  will  be  sensible.  at.  .last,  that  100,000  rum  of  such  mettle,  as  triumphed.on  the  16th  are  not  only  competent  to  resist  the  invaders  ;  but  to  lash  them,  covered  with  shame  and  con confusion,  fusion, confusion,  beyond  the  Pyrenees.  .  On  Wednesday,  the  11th,  the  army  reachtie  Corunna.  On  the  12th,  the  advanced-guard  of  the  French  arrived  at  Betauzos,  a  place  about  twelve  miles  from  Corunna.  On  the  evening  of  the  14th,  a  hundred  sail  of  transports  en-  '  tered  the  bay  from  Vigo;  and  the  following  day  the  re remainder  mainder remainder  arrived.  By  this  tune  the  greater  part  of  the  enemy  appeared  in  the  neighbourhood,  and  occupied  the  adjacent  heights;  so  that  the  Commander  in  Chief  could  no  longer  expect  to  continue  the  embarkation,  which  be began  gan began  on  the  14th,  without  interruption  ;  and,  in  fact,  our  troops  were  engaged,  during  the  whole  of  that  day,  in  in incessant  cessant incessant  ,kirmishes  with  the  enemy.  They  declined,  how how'inter,  'inter, how'inter,  a  general  engagement,  as  their  intention  manifestly  was  to  prevent  our  embarkation  till  their  entire  force  had  arrived,  when  they  thought  themselves  certain  of  over overwhelming  whelming overwhelming  our  army.  These  having  accordingly  arrived  i:nder  the  command,  as  it  is  said,  of  .14170  T,  the  enemy  were  seen,  early  on  the  16th,  making  a  movement,  evinc evincing  ing evincing  an  intention  to  envelope  our  men;  whilst  their  principal  force  was  directed,  however,  against  our  right.  wing,  which  was  towards  Encobras,  and  consisted  of  the  4th,  42d,  and  50th  regiments,  composing  the  brigade  of  Lord  Be:NITINCK.  Under  these  circumstances  Sir  liar,  MOORE  prepared  to  sustain  an  engagement,  which  was  now  become  unavoidable.  Our  position  was  reconnoitered  by  Marshal  SovLT,  be between  tween between  10  and  11  o'clock  in  the  morning,  and  the  attack  7S  was  notwithstanding  a  feint  upon  our  left  by  a  column  and  four  pieces  of  artillery,  made  by  the  French  upon  our  right  wing,  with  great  impetuosity,  and  resisted  by  our  gallant  troops  with  undaunted  firmness  and  perseverance.  It  was  obviously  the  design  of  the  enemy  to  turn  the  right  wing,  and  thus  interpose  between  th©  army  and  the  place  of  em embarkation.  barkation. embarkation.  The  heroic  gallantry  of  men  and  officers  frnstrated  this  attempt  ;  and  notwithstanding  their  repeated  elrorts,  the/  were,  in  every  new  attack,  repulsed  with  great  slaughter..  At  last  some  confusion  appearing  in  their  ranks,  our  men  became,  in  their  turn,  the  assailants.  The  charge  was  made  with  the  bayonet  ;  and  on  this,  as  on  every  other  occasion,  the  enemy  were  not  able  to  resist  it  a  single  in instant.  stant. instant.  In  this  attack,  during  which  the  whole  army  cover covered  ed covered  itself  with  glory,  the  Guards,  it  is  said,  particularly  sig signalized  nalized signalized  themselves.  The  French  were  so  completeV  rout routed,  ed, routed,  and  fled  with  such  precipitation,  that  they  did  not  dare  re-appear  for  fourteen  hours  afterwards.  This  in interval  terval interval  was  occupied  in  embarking  our  troops.  Thus  an  engagement,  where  the  desparity  of  numbers  were  so  very  considerable,  was  decided  by  the  irresistible  effect  of  the  British  bayonet,  in  less  than  three  hours,  from  two  o'clock  till  five  in  the  evening.  Our  loss,  on  the  occasion.  is  much  less  than  could  ha%  n  been  expected,  not  exceeding  in  killed  and  wounded  seven  hundred  men  ;  among  whom  are  several  officers,—a  glori glorious  ous glorious  and  incontestible  proof  of  their  bravery  I  In  the  begin beginning  ning beginning  of  the  engagement  Sir  J.  Nlooas  received  the  fatal  blow  on  the  breast,  by  a  nearly  spent  cannon  ball.  Sir  DAVID  BAIRD'S  arms  was  shot  away►  near  the  socket  by  a  chain  shot,  but,  with  inexpressible  pleasure,  we  announce  that  hopes  are  entertained  of  his  recovery.  The  command  of  the  army  then  devolved  on  Lieut.-General  Horn,  who,  no  this  arduous  occasion  di:-played  equal  bravery,  foresight  and  activity.  The  command  could  not  have  fallen  to  the  share  of  a  more  worthy  Officer.  The  transports  with  our  troops  from  Corunna,  we  are  happy  to  state  are  already  arrived.  Almost  all  the  letters  from  our  sea-ports  coincide  in  depicting  a  sce►►e  of  distress  and  horror  inexpressible.

The  euemy,  finding  himself  foiled  in  every  attempt  to  force  the  right  of  the  Position,  endeavoured  by  numbers  to  turn  it.  A  judicious  and  well-timed  movement  which  was  made  by  Ma Major-General  jor-General Major-General  Paget,  with  the  reserve,  which  Corps  had  moved  out  of  its  Cantonments  to  support  the  R  ight  of  the  Army,  by  a  rigorous  attack  ,  defeated  this  intention.

This  circumstance,  with  the  position  of  Lieut.-(:en.  e'raser's  division  (calculated  to  give  still  further  security  to  the  right  of  the  line),  induced  the  enemy  to  relax  his  etfart  in  that  quarter.  They  were  however  more  forcibly  directed  to  A%  arils  the  centre,  Noliere  they  were  again  successfully  resisted  by  the  brigade  under  Major-General  Manningliam,  forming  the  left  of  Sour  division,  and  a  part  of  that  under  Major-General  Leith,  forming  the  right  of  the  division  under  my  orders.  Upon  the  left,  the  enemy  at  first  contented  himself  with  an  attack  upon  our  pique's,  which  however  in  general  maintained  their  ground.  Finding  however  his  efforts  unavailing  on  the  right  and  centre,  he  seemed  de determined  termined determined  to  reader  the  attack  upon  the  left  more  serious,  and  had  succeeded  in  obtaining  possession  of  the  village  through  which  the  great  road  to  Madrid  passes,  and  which  was  situnted  in  front  of  that  part  of  the  line.  From  this  ost,  however,  he  was  soon  expelled,  with  considerable  foss,  by  a  gallant  attack  of  some  companies  of  the  _second  battalion  14th  Regiment,  under  Lieut.  Col.  Niccolls;  before  Ave  in  the  evening,  we  had  not  only  successfully  repelled  every  attack  made  upon  the  position,  but  had  gained  ground  in  almost  al)  points,  and  occupied  a  more  forward  line,  than  at  the  com commencement  mencement commencement  of  the  action,  whilst  the  enemy  confined  his  opera operations  tions operations  to  a  cannonade,  and  the  tire  of  hislight  troops,  with  a  view  to  drlw  off  his  other  corps.  At  six  the  tiring  entirely  ceased.

The  troops  quitted  their  position  about  ten  at  night,  with  a  degree  of  order  that  did  them  credit.  The  whole  of  the  artillery  that  remained  tmembarked,  having  been-  is  ithdrawn,  the  troops  followed  in  the  order  prescribed,  and  marched  to  their  respective  points  of  embarkation  in  the  town  and  neighbourhood  of  Corunna.  The  piquets  remained  at  their  posts  until  five  on  the  morning  of  the  17th,  when  they  were  also  withdrawn  with  similar  orders,  and  without  th.'  rue ruemy  my ruemy  having  discovered  the  movement.  By  the  unremitted  exertion  of  Captains  the  lion.  11.  Curzon,  Cossselin,  Boss,  Rainier,  Secret,  Haw  .

Bowen  amid  Shepherd,  and  the STYLE=superscript  other  Agents  for  transports,  the  whole  of  the  army  was  embarked  with  au  expedition  which  has  seldom  been  equalled.  With  the  exception  of  the  brigades  under  Major  Generals  11111  and  Beresford,  which  mere  destined  to  remain  on  shore,  moil  the  movements  of  the  enemy  should  become  manifest,  the  whole  was  afloat  before  day-light.  The  brigade  of  Major-General  Beresford,  which  was  alter alternately  nately alternately  to  form  our  rear-guard,  occupied  the  land  front  of  the  town  of  Comma;  that  under  Major-General  Hill  was  stationed  in  reserve  on  the  prmuontory  hi  rear  of  the  town.  The  enemy  pushed  the  light  troops  towards  the  town  soon  after  eight  o'clock  in  the  morning  of  the  17  th,  and  shortly  after  occu occupied  pied occupied  the  heights  of  St.  Lucia,  which  command  the  harbour.  But  notwithstanding  this  circumstance,  and  the  manifest  detects  of  the  place,  there  being  no  apprehension  that  the  rear-guard  could  be  forced,  and  the  disposition  of  the  Spaniards  appear appearing  ing appearing  to  he  good,  the  embarkation  of  Major-General  It  ill's  brigade  was  commenced  and  completed  by  three  in  the  after afternoon;  noon; afternoon;  Major-Gen.  Beresford,  with  that  zeal  and  ability  which  is  so  well  known  to  y  ourself  and  the  army,  having  fully  explain explained,  ed, explained,  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Spanish  Governor,  the  nature  of  our  movement,  and  having  made  every  previous  arrangement,  withdrew  his  corps  from  the  Land  !rout  of  the  town  soon  after  dark,  and  was,  with  all  the  w  minded  that  had  not  been  pre,  viously  moved,embarked  before  one  this  morning.  Circumstances  forbid  us  to  indulge  the  hope,  that  the  Vic,  tory  with  which  it  has  pleased  providence  to  crown  the  efforts  of  the  army,  can  be  attended  w  it  h  any  very  brilliant  consequences  to  Great  Britain.  It  is  clouded  by  the  loss  of  one  of  her  best  soldiers.  It  has  been  atchieved  at  the  termination  of  a  long  amid  barrassing  service.  The  superior  numbers  of  the  enemy  ,  not  less  than  the  actual  situation  of  this  army,  did  not  admit  of  any  advantage  being  reaped  from  success.  It  must  be  however  to  you  the  sweetest  reflection  that  the  lustre  of  the  British  arms  has  been  maintained,  amidst  many  disadvantageous  circumstan circumstances.  ces. circumstances.  The  army  which  had  entered  Spain,  amidst  the  fairest  prospects,  had  no  sooner  eompleated  its  junetion,  than  owing  to  the  multiplied  disasters  that  dispersed  the  native  armies  around  us,  it  was  left  to  its  own  resources.  The  advance  of  the  British  corps  from  the  Duero,  afforded  the  hest  hope  that  the  South  of  Spain  might  be  relieved,  by  this  generous  effort  to  save  the  unfortunate  people,  also  afforded  the  enemy  the  opportunity  of  directing  every  effort  of  his  numerous  troops,  and  concentrating  all  his  principal  resources  for  the  de destruction  struction destruction  of  the  only  regular  force  in  the  North  of  Spain.  You  are  well  aware  with  what  diligence  this  system  has  been  pursued.  These  circumstances  produced  the  necessity  of  rapid  awl  liar liarrinsing  rinsing liarrinsing  marches,  which  had  diminished  the  numbers,  exhausted  the  strength,  and  impaired  the  equipment  of  the  army.  All  these  disadvantages,  and  those  more  immediately  attached  to  a  defensive  Position,  which  the  imperious  necessity  of  covering  toe  harbour  of  Corunna  for  a  time  had  rendered  indispposable  to  assume,  the  native  and  undaunted  valour  of  British  trulops  was  never  more  conspicuous,  and  must  have  exceeded  what  even  your  own  experience  of  that  invaluable  quality,  so  inherent  In  them,  may  have  taught  you  to  expect.

'Co  these  officers,  and  the  troops  under  their  immediate  orders,  the  greatest  praise  is  due.  Major-General  Hill  and  Colonel  Catlin  Crauford,  with  their  brigades  on  the  left  of  the  position,  ably  supported  their  advanced  posts.  The  brunt  of  the  action  fell  upon  the  4th,  42d,  50th,  and  81st  regiments,  with  parts  of  •  the  brigade  of  Guards,  and  the  `?6th  regiment.  From  Lieutenant  Colonel  Murray,  Quarter-Master-General,  and  the  officers  of  the  General  Staff,  I.  received  the  most  marked  assistance.  l  had  reason  to  regret,  that  the  illness  of  Brigadier-General  Clinton,.

I  was  indebted  to  Brigadier-General  Slade  during  the  action,  for  a  zealous  offer  of  his  personal  services,  although  the  cavalry  were  embarked.  The  greater  part  of  the  fleet  having  gone  to  sea  yesterday  evening,  the  whole  being  under  weigh,  and  the  corps  in  the  embarkation  necessarily  much  mixed  on  board,  it  is  impossible  at  present  to  lay  before  you  a  return  of  our  casualties.  1  hope  the  loss  in  numbers  is  not  so  considerable  as  might  have  been  ex expected.  pected. expected.  If  I  was  obliged  to  form  an  estimate  I  should  say,  that  I  believe  it  did  not  exceed  in  killed  and  wounded  from  seven  to  eight  hundred  ;  that  of  the  enemy  must  remain  unknown,  but  many  circumstances  induce  me  to  rate  it  at  nearly  double  the  above  number.  We  have  some  prisoners  but  I  have  not  been  able  to  obtain  an  account  of  the  number  ;  it  is  not,  however,  considerable.

To  you  who  are  well  acquainted  with  the  excellent  qualities  of  Lieut.  Gen.  Sir  John  Moore,  I  need  not  expatiate  on  the  loss  the  army  and  the  country  has  sustained  by  his  death.  His  fall  has  deprived  me  of  a  valuable  friend,  to  whom  long  experience  of  his  worth  had  sincerely  attached  to  me.  But  it  is  chiefly  on  public  grounds  that  I  must  lament  the  blow.  It  will  be  the  conversation  of  every  one  who  loved  or  respected  his  manly  character,  that,  after  conducting  the  army  through  an  arduous  retreat  with  consummate  firmness,  he  has  terminated  a  career  of  distinguished  honour  by  a  death  that  has  given  the  enemy  ad additional  ditional additional  reason  to  respect  the  name  of  a  British  soldier.

There  is  postive.  ly  something  frightful,  as  well  unmanly,  in  the  vulgarised  evan•  gelical  phisiognotny.  It  is  not  easy  to  avoid  being,  very  pai  ils  fully  affected  at  hearing  a  man,  with  looks  rather  condemning  than  consecrated,  warning  some  of  his  auditors  to  nee  from  1  damnation  and  exhorting  some  to  rejoice  in  their  being  still  Oat  of  and  on  Christianity  ought  to  inspire  its  teachers  with  satisfied  sensations,  arising  from  the  calmness  of  conscience,  from  the  voice  within  ;  and  to  '  endue  them  with  correct  conceptions,  decent  dignity,  and  holy  boldness,  in  their  addresses  to  their  congregations.  Dr.  Draper  is  not,  1  hope,  become  ashamed  of  appearing  to  be  one  of  men  of  who  are  so  much  the  objects  of  ‘atfecti  d  contempt  among  the  party  with  which  he  is  now  acting.  Such  phrases  as  you  and  I  and  Who'd  have  Do  you  nsk  the  why?  I'll  tell  you  phrases,  and  others  of  the  same  Almi),  are  not  to  be  defended  by  his  exclaiming,  speaking  of  Vmself,  Don't  Say  this  •Fel •Fellow  low •Fellow  (meaaiug  himself)  is  a  Methodist,  and  therefore  he  is  obliged  to  talk  in  this  &amp;c.  &amp;c.  Nothing  &amp;generates  so  rapidly  as  the  human  mind  when  it  abandons  the  principles  of  cultivated  excellence.  lam  sorry  to  hear  Dr.  Draper  decrying  intelkctual  attainments;  and,  in  compliance  with  the  degrading  cant  of  many  other  evangelical  orators,  seeming  to  despise  those  talents  to  which  he  owes  his  superiority.  My  concern,  as  to  this  last  particular,  apptoaches  to  indignation,  when  I  suspect  that  Dr.  Draper,  in  depreciating  literary  perfections,  does  not  speak  his  explicit  sentiments.  Has  he  not.  associated  a,  ith  Vic Victory  tory Victory  characters  ?  Has  he  not,  within  the  two  last  year,  obtain obtained  ed obtained  two  prizes,  on  political  questions,  at  one  of  the  public  Dc Dcbating-Societies  bating-Societies Dcbating-Societies  ;  where  lie  had  spoken  before,  with  consider considerable  able considerable  applause?  If  my  information  be  not  here  seriously  correct,  1  um  most  egregiously  deceived.  how  ill  does  it  hcarem  Dr.  Draper,  then,  to  preach  against  composition  awl  eloquence!  His  depreciation  of  literature  and  oratory  ..  is  as  impolitic  as  it  is  improper.  Ile  must  cultivate  both  literature  and  oratory,  instead  of  neglecting  thaw  excellent  qualifications;  or  he  must  ~,  be  content  to  confine  his  exertions  to  Spa-fields,  and  the  Loudon  Itinerant  Society.  Vulgarity  of  manner  and  language  will  not  now  succeed  in  Orange-street  Chapel.  The  great  attraction  of  Dr.  Draper's  preaching  is  its  fluency.  It  is  of  the  conversational  description  ;  he  takes.  you  as  it  were  by  the  Nato.'  ;  and  familiarly,  though  not  forcibly,  detains  ,  raw  iteteation.  •  He  shakes  •yise  by  the  handoend  - STYLE=superscript  yort  are  In-  6 STYLE=superscript  1  dined  tolistivo  to  what  be  has  to  say,  His  may  he  &amp;gritted  as  the  how-d'ye-do  style  of  preaching.

Ills  voice  is  harsh,  but  audible  ;  aid  his  enunciation  is  distinct.  his  eloquence  is  prompt  and  unimpeded.  •  His  exordiums  are  too  long.  His  discourses,  however,  are  often  interesting  and  instructive;  and  they  are  far  more  rational  than  his  prayers.  lie  reasons  his  argument  with  great  force,  and  is  generally  apt,  but,  almost  as  generally,  low  to  his  illus illustrations.  trations. illustrations.

Ile  possesses  considerable  information  ;  and  on  this  account,  no  less  than  on  account  of  the  popularity  of  his  de delivery,  livery, delivery,  he  might  render  himself  highly  useful  and  honourably  distinguished.  Too  much  is  it  to  be  apprehended,  that  unworthy  ambition  will,  notwithstanding  his  abilities  and  advantages,  operate  against  Dr.  Draper's  actual.  attainment  of  substantial  dignity.  lie  appears  to  mistake  popularity  for  reputation.  As  there  exist  those  who  expect  to  be  heard  for  their  touch  speaking,  so  there  will  he  found  those  who  look  to  be  remembered  because  they  are  often  mentioned.  Dr.  Draper  seems  also  misplaced  in  In  the  arrangement  of  our  social  system.  Instead  of  being  stationed  as  a  Minister  of  Christianity,  he  ought,  I  conceive,  to  have  figured  as  a  Member  of  Parliament.  A  man  should  not  feud  himself  necessitated  to  intercede  for  the  government  of  his  country  in  the  pulpit,  when  be  might  hove  patriotically  arraigned  its  measures  in  the  senate.  I  have  heard  that  Dr.  Draper  is  the  author  of  some  sermons  on  the  Liturgy.  lie  is  certainly  an  acquisition  to  Spa-Fields  Chapel,  and  even  to  the  College  at  Cheshunt.  lle  will  do  well,  nevertheless,  not  to  imitate  the  dictatorial  arrogance,  the  self selfrighteous  righteous selfrighteous  importance,  with  which  Dr.  flaweis  superinteuded  t  he  concerns  of  the  countess  of  lieutingdon.

The  sudden  thaw  has  produced  effects  in  the  streets  of  the  Me Metropolis.,  tropolis., Metropolis.,  and  the  roads  in  the  neighbourhood,  which  have  been  scarcely  paralelled  at  any  former  period.  The  water  produced  by  the  melting  of  a  vast  body  of  snow,  has  rendered  some  of  the  rinds  quite  impassable,  and  the  torrents  which  have  thus  been  cawed,  have  dune  great  damage.
