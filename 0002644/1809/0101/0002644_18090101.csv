FOREIGN  INTELLIGENCE.  FROX  THE  FRENCH  PAPERS.  FOURTEENTH  BULLETIN  OF  THE  ARMY  OF  SPAIN.  MADRID,  DEC.  5.----The  2d  at  noon  his  Majesty  arrived  in  person  on  the  heights  w  hich  impend  over  Madrid,  on  which  were  already  placed  the  divisions  of  dragoons  olGenerals  Latour  Mau Mauhoug,  houg, Mauhoug,  and  Lahoussaye,  and  the  imperial  horse-guards.  The  anniversary  of  the  coronation,  that  epoque  which  has  si  g  nalised  so  many  days  fur  ever  fortunate  for  France,  awakene  d  in  all  hearts  the  most  agreeable  recollections,  and  inspired  all  the  troops  with  an  enthusiasm  which  manifested  itself  in  a  thousand  exclamations.  The  weather  was  beautiful,  and  like  that  enjoyed  in  France  in  the  month  of  May.  The  Marshal.  Duke  of  Istria  sent  to  summon  the  town,  where  a  Military  Junta  was  formed,  .ander  the  presidency  of  the  Marquis  of  Castelaur,  who  had  under  his  orders  General  Morla,  Captain-General  of  Anda Andalusia.  lusia. Andalusia.  The  town  contained  a  number  of  'armed  peasants,  as assembled  sembled assembled  from  all  quarters,  6000  troops  of  the  line,  and  100  pieces  of  cannon.  Sixty  thousand  men  were  in  arms.  Their  cries  were  heard  on  every  side  :  the  bells  of  200  churches  rung  altogether;  and  every  thing  presented  theappearance  of  disorder  and  madness.  The  General  of  the  troops  of  the  line  appeared  at  the  advanced  posts  to  answer  the  summons  of  the  Duke  of  Istria.  .He  was  accompanied  by  30  men  of  the  people,  whose  dress,  looks,  and  ferocious  language,  recalled  the  recollection  of  the  assassins  of  September.  When  the  Spanish  General  was  asked  whether  he  meant  to  expose  women,  children,  and  old  men  to  the  horrors  of  an  assault,  he  manifested  secretly  the  grief  with  which  he  was  penetrated;  he  made  known  by  signs,  that  he,  as  well  as  all  the  honest  men  of  Madrid,  groaned  under  oppression  !  and  when  he  raised  his  voice,  his  words  were  dictated  by  the  wretches  who  watched  over  him.  No  doubt  could  be  enter entertained  tained entertained  of  the  excess  to  which  the  tyranny  of  the  multitude  was  carried  when  they  saw  him  write  down  all  his  words,  and  caused  the  record  to  he  verified  by  the  assassins  who  surrounded  him.  The  aid-de-camp  of  the  Duke  of  Istria,  who  had  been  sent  into  the  town,  was  seized  by  men  of  the  lowest  class  of  penpie,  and  was  about  to  be  massacred,  hen  the  troops  of  the  line,  indignant  at  the  outrage,  took  him  under  their  protection,  and  caused  him  to  be  restored  to  his  General.  4  butcher's  boy  from  Estremadura,  who  commanded  one  of  the  gates,  had  the  audacity  to  require  that  the  Duke  of  Istria  should  go  himself  into  the  town  with  his  e  ,ues  blindfolded.  General  Mont Montbran  bran Montbran  rdected  this  presumptuous  demand  with  indignation.  He  teas  immediately  surrounded,  and  effected  his  escape  only  by  draw drawing  ing drawing  his  sword.

Those  of  the  inhabitants  who  despaired  ol  a  successial  resistance  were  flying  into  the  fields;  others,  who  had  reser..  ed  some  share  of  reason,  and  who  preferred  appearing  in  the  aidst  of  their  prorrty  before  a  generoas  (witty,  to  abandoning  it  to  the  pillage  of  their  fellow  citi:xas,  dem:coded  that  they  should  not  expose  themselves  to  an  assault.

During  the  night  the  most  mutinous  withdrew  themselves  from  'he  danger  by  flight,  and  a  part  of  the  troops  was  disbanded.  At  ten  o'clock,  on  the  sth,  Gen.  Belliard  took  the  command  of  Madrid  ;  all  the  posts  were  put  into  the  hands  of  the  French,  and  a  general  pardon  was  proclaimed.  From  this  moment,  men,  women,  and  children,  spread  them themselves  selves themselves  about  the  streets  in  perfect  security.  The  shops  were  open  till  eleven  o'clock.—All  the  citizens  set  themselves  to  de destroy  stroy destroy  the  barricades  and  re-pave  the  streets,  the  monks  returned  into  their  Convents,  and  in  a  few  hours  Madrid  presented  the  most  extraordinary  contrast,  a  contrast  inexplicable  to  those  unaccumstomed  to  the  manners  of  great  towns.

Fifty  thousand  stand  of  arms  have  been  given  up,  and  100  pieces  of  cannon  are  collected  at  the  Retiro.  The  anguish  in  which  the  inhabitants  of  this  wretched  city  ha%o  lived  for  these  four  months  cannot  be  described.  The  Junta  was  without  influence;  the  molt  ignorant  and  maddest  of  men  had  all  the  power  in  their  hands,  and  the  people  at  every  instant  massacred,  or  threatened  with  the  gallows,  their  Magistrate;  and  t  i  r  Generals.

The  Duke  of  Istria  is  gone  in  pursuit  of  the  division  of  Pena,  which.  having  escaped  from  the  battle  of  Tudela,  took  the  route  of  Ouadalaxara.  Florida  Manus,  and  the  Junta,  had  fled  to  'l'uledo.  They  did  not  thiuk  themselves  in  safety  In  that  town  neither,  and  have  gone  to  take  refuge  with  the  English.  The  conduct  of  the  English  is  shameful.  On  the  20th  Novem November  ber November  they  were  at  the  Escurial  to  the  number  of  6001)  men.  They  pretended  they  would  do  nothing  less  than  pass  the  Pyrenees,  and  come  to  the  Garrnne.  Their  troops  are  very  fine,  and  well  disciplined.  The  confidence  with  which  they  had  inspired  the  Spaniards  is  inconceivable.  Same  hoped  that  this  division  would  go  to  Sonsosierra;  others,  that  it  would  come  to  defend  he  capital  of  so  dear  an  ally.  Scarcely  were  they  informed  that  the  Emperor  was  at  Somosierra,  when  the  English  troops  beat  a  retreat  on.the  Escurial.  From  thence,  combining  their  march  with  the  division  which  was  at  Salamanca,  they  have  taken  their  course  towards  the  sea.  Arms,  powder,  and  clothing,  they  have  given  to  said  a  Spaniard,  but  their  soldiers  came  only  to  excite  us,  to  lead  us  astray,  ataFto  abandon  us  in  the  critical  But  are  you  answered  the  French  Officer,  of  the  most  recent  facts  of  our  history.

PROVINCIAL§.  An  unparalleled  instance  of  cruelty,  superstition,  and  awful  visitation,  occurred  a  short  period  since  in  the  Hundred  of  Hoo  ;  a  farmer  of  the  name  of  Fenner  lost  a  considerable  quantity  of  poultry  by  a  distemper  with  which  they  were  seized;  and  hav-  .  ing,  some  time  prior  to  their  mortality,  received  a  present  of  a  duck  from  a  friend,  it  was  supposed,  from  her  laying  dun-co dun-coloured  loured dun-coloured  eggs,  that  she  had  been  bewitched  by  an  elderly  woman  in  the  neighbourhood,  and  that  such  was  the  cause  of  the  losses  sustained.  In  order  to  prevent  a  recurrence  of  similar  disasters,  and  to  break  the  enchantment,  it  was  determined,  by  an  igno ignorant  rant ignorant  and  superstitious  female  servant,  to  burn  the  ill-fated  but  innocent  victim  alive;  which  horrid  resolution  she  one  morning  carried  into  practice,  by  putting  the  poor  animal  in  an  oven,  and  burning  a  faggot  of  wood  over  her;  which,  though  it  com completely  pletely completely  consumed  alt  her  feathers,  did  not  extinguish  the  vital  'park  :  on  the  following  morning  she  repeated  her  cruelty,  not notwithstanding  withstanding notwithstanding  which  the  poor  dusk  still  retained  animation  :  on  the  third  day,  being  determined  to  effect  her  barbarous  intention,  she  had  recourse  to  the  following  shocking  expedient—she  set  tire  to  a  large  faggot  in  the  even,  and  when  it  bad  completely  caught  the  flame,  she  put  the  already  tortured  body  of  the  poor  duck  on  it,  and  confined  it  down;  this  soon  terminated  its  exist existence.  ence. existence.  In  a  short  period,  from  her  inhuman  conduct,  this  un unfortunate  fortunate unfortunate  dupe  of  superstition  and  ignorance  was  seized  with  fits;  which  appears  like  an  awful  dispensation  of  Providence,  tit  deprive  her  of  that  life  which  she  was  unworthy  of,  as  she  urvived  but  a  few  days  after,  expiring  in  the  greatest  agonies.  Ilut.t.,  DEC.  24.--A  heavy  fall  of  snow  comMenced  on  Satur Saturday  day Saturday  last,  and  has  continued,  with  little  intermission,  every  suc succeeding  ceeding succeeding  day,  accompanied  by  a  strong  gale  of  wind  a  great  part  of  the  time,  from  the  north  and  north-west.  The  quantity  of  snow  that  has  fallen  in  this  neighbourhood  is  so  great,  that  in  many  places  the  road  has  been  rendered  impassable  for  carriages.  The  mail,  and  other  coaches  from  York,  have  not  reached  this  place  since  Saturday  last.  The  Doncaster  coach,  by  way  of  Howden,  which  should  have  come  in  on  Sunday  night,  arrived  here  yesterday.  On  Sunday,  and  the  following  days,  the  bags,  with  the  mails  from  York,  were  brought  in  between  ten  and  elevca  o'clock  each•  day,  on  horseback,  from  York,  the  mail  guard  having  to  ride  eighty  miles  each  day,  through  the  snow,  with  the  mails;  one  of  them  was  so  severely  fatigued  that  h  ,, STYLE=superscript  lies  at  Bishop  Burton,  very  dangerously  ill.  In  the  neighbour neighbourhood  hood neighbourhood  of  Market  Weighton  the  snow  was  drifted  so  much  as  to  he  level  with  the  hedges  an  each  side.  NE A  sr  E,  DEC.  24.—0  n  Saturday  and  Sunday  last,  a  severe  storm  of  snow,  attended  by  a  violent  gale  of  wind,  came  on  in  this  neighbourhoOd.  It  has,  we  understand,  been  very  generally  felt  along  the  northern  and  eastern  coasts.  The  roads  in  many  •  places  near  this  town  were  obliged  to  be  cut,  particularly  tho'e  that  ran  in  an  easterly  direction.  In  the  Last  Riding  of  York Yorkshire  shire Yorkshire  the  fall  of  snow  has  been  so  heavy  as  entirely  to  suspend  land  conveyance.  The  Telegraph  from  this  town  to  Hull  did  not  for  several  days  reach  its  destination.  '  Wednesday  sennight,  during  the  performance  of  High  Life  firlaw  Stairs,  one  of  the  dressing-rooms  of  North-Shields  Thew,:  took  fire,  and  several  dresses  were  consumed  before  the  flames  were  extinguished.  There  being  an  abundance  of  snow  in  the  streets,  the  fire  was  soon  got  under  by  carrying  buckets-full  into  the  Theatre.  An  alarming  fire  broke  out,  about  six  o'clock  on  Wednesday  evening  last,  in  the  dwelling-house  of  Mrs.  Swale,  tanner,  of  Ipswich,  occasioned  by  culpable  inattention  to  the  kitchen  chimney,  which  had  been  observed  on  tire  during  the  greater  part  of  the  day,  but  no  steps  were  taken  to'suppress  the  same;  and  in  consequence  it  communicated  to  the  roof,  and  ultimately  de destroyed  stroyed destroyed  the  whole  house,  notwithstanding  the  most  active  exer exertions  tions exertions  of  the  military  and  neighbouring  inhabitants,  through  whose  means  the  bark-houses  and  adjacent  buildings  were  preserved  from  the  ravages  of  the  flames,  which  appeared  more  dreadful  than  ans  - STYLE=superscript  conflagration  ever  recollec:e  !  in  that  town.

Liddle  endeavouring  to  knock  it  from  the  villain's  hand,  struck  at  it,  upon  which  the  robbers  threw  him  down,  bound  him,  and  carrying  him  into  an  adjacent  planta plantation,  tion, plantation,  tied  him  up  to  a  tree,  when  they  robbed  him  of  a  parcel,  containing  about  1001.  in  bank-notes,  and  also  of  151.  his  own  property.  Liddle  was  found,  by  some  people  who  heard  his  cries,  forty  minutes  after  the  robbery,  nearly  exhausted  with  cold  and  pain,  the  villains  had  tied  him  in  such  a  position,  that  only  his  toes  could  reach  the  ground.  On  Wednesday  evening,  near  seven  o'clock,  as  Mr.  Robert  Jackson,  pilot,  of  th•  Bull  Inn.  Stepney,  was  returning  home  from  Hull,  he  was  joined,  a  little  beyond  Spring-row,  by  a  man,  who,  after  walking  with  him  a  little  way,  knocked  him  down  with  a  bludgeon,  as  he  supposed.  Mr.  Jackson  cried  out  4  murder  the  man  retreated  from  him  a  few  yards;  and  some  persons  at  no  great  distance  repeating  the  cry  of  he  hastily  ran  off,  and  threw  himself  into  the  ditch  among  the  snow.  Mr.  Jackson  got  up  and  followed  him,  and  on  his  coming  up  to  the  spot,  stopping  near  it  a  short  time,  the  man  jumped  up  and  asked  w  hat  he  was  making  a  noise  about  ?  Mr.  Jackson  said  he  had  been  knocked  down,  and  asked  him  to  assist  in  pur pursuing  suing pursuing  the  assailant.  This  he  apparently  consented  to  do,  and  on  coming  up  to  some  persons,  who  were  drawn  to  the  spot  by  the  noise,  Mr.  J.  seized  the  man,  and  charged  him  with  the  assault.  On  going  to  the  spot  where  the  man  had  been  secreted,  a  hatchet  was  found  in  the  ditch,  with  which  it  is  presumed  the  blow  had  been  given.—The  man  was  brought  to  Scolcoates,  and  lodged  in  the  House  of  Correction  at  that  place.

The  conflagration  was  so  tremendous  that  little  could  be  saved,  ex except  cept except  some  papers,  plate,  and  jewels.  The  accident  was  occa occasioned  sioned occasioned  by  a  lighted-candle  being  left  in  a  dressing-room,  which  set  fire  to  one  of  the  curtains,  and  spread  so  rapidly  as  not  to  be  extinguished.

It  is  reported  that  this  junction  had  4een  actually  effected.  HOwever,  we  have  the  satisfaction  to  announce,  that  theeneiny  had  not  the  means  of  preventing  .  it,  as:  soon  as  our  Generals  thought  'it  adviiable.  Thci  .

Be  that  •  •  as  it  may,  we  feel  the  most  inexpressible  satisfaction  at  the  contents  of  their  dispatches  ;  and,  whatever  fate  awaits  our  brave  country  Men,  we  may  indulge,  With  confidence,  in  the  exulting.  anticipation,  that  officers  atid  MOW  will  not  only  do  their  dote  r  lint'every  thing  which  the  most'ardent  love  of  their  country',  and,  the  rO  - STYLE=superscript  4,t  heroic  valour  are  capable  of  performing  a  .

We  should  entertain  no  apprehension  •  were  60,000  of  the  enemy  opposed  to  them,  but  when  they  have  it  in  their  power  to  double  tha't  number,  we  shall  not  be  ,guilty  of  the  madness  or  inhumanity  of  leaving  them  to  contend  against  such  fearful  odds.  We  expect  Much  from  the  Spaniards  ;  ice  repo  s  e  the  most  unlimitted  confidence  in  their  courage  and  fidelity  ;  but  let  us  now  act,  as  if  our  force  was  left  solely  to  its  own  exertions.  We  feel  the  .  rpost  genuine  satin-  faction  that  our  wishes  have  been  anticipated  by  Govern Government,  ment, Government,  and  that  several  regiments  have  embarked,  and  ethers  have  received  orders  for  embarkation,  to  join  our  army  in  Spain.  We  wish  that  every  regiment,  the  moment  it  em embarked,  barked, embarked,  sailed  immediately  for  its  destination;  which,we  suppose  to  be  Vigo,  to  order  to  prevent  any  unnecessa unnecessary  ry unnecessary  delay.  On  landing  they  can  immediately  proceed  to  join  the  main  body  of  their  countrymen,  as  no  impe impe'diment  'diment impe'diment  to  theiri  junction  can  take  place  in  that  direction.  By  these  means  complaints  of  scarcity  of  provisions  will  be  obviated  ;  and  we  shall  not  have  the  mortification  of  seeing  a  considerable  part  of  our  troops,  as  was  the  case  with  Sir  DAVID  Batan's  force,  wasting  their  time  at  the  place  of  landing,  However  thp  last  dispatches  have  realised  the  fondest  of  our  wishes  ;  and  the  country  is  now  placed  in  a  situation,  in  which  it  should  have  long  since  appeared.

The  British  ,•.;  character  is  particularly  formed  for  great  and  darinr  enterprise;  an  'it  betrays  the  must  revolting  ignorance  of  it,  and  a  most  unwarrantable  diffidence  in  its  resources,  to  confine  it  to  puny  'exertions,  It  is  this  conviction,  which  excites  this  triumphant  extiltation  on  our  part,  that  we  are  0  •  now  placed  in  a  situation,  trom  which  the  low  dictates  of  false  policy,  or  the  miserable  'combinations  of  selfishness  cannot  prevail  on  us  to  draw  ba  ti  k.  We  see  once  more  in  idea  the  days  of  the  EDWARDS,'  of  11.ENRY  I  and  of  MARL MARLricition  ricition MARLricition  revived;  and  whatever  pietis,ts  may  say,  warfare.  vn  the  principles,  we  carry  it  on,  so  far  from  injuring  the  moral  character  of  the  community,  mast  tend  to  exalt  it.  It  is  only  necessary  to  converse  with  th'C  soldier,  who  has  seen  years  of  active  service,  to  he  convinced  there  is  not  a  more  estimable  character,  or  a  worthier  man.  It  is  activity  alone  which  corrupts  States,  as  veil  as  individuals  ;  '  and  as  soon  as  100,000  British  soldiers  'appear  on  the  t7outinent,  experience  will  prove,  that  the  imOlitse  given  by  •  Such  an  event  to  the  popular  feelings,  will  have  a  grea  t  and  •  Salutary  influence  oil  oar  national  character.  •  .  .  The  enemy  has  at  last  sent  us  three  additional  Bulletins,  the  14th,  15th,  and  16th,  The  first  of  these  is  dated  Ma Madrid  drid Madrid  the  sth  ;  and  the  last  on  the  Bth,  from  the  same  place.  They  principally  refer  to  the  particulars  of  the  surrender  of  the  Capital,  and  to  some  military  demonstrations  previous  to  that  event.  The  accounts  we  received  at  ditierent  inter intervals,  vals, intervals,  of  the  determination  of  the  inhabitants  to  defend  the  city,  were  perfectly  true  ;  and  if  the  prudence  of  the  Ge Generals  nerals Generals  had  not  restrained  their  resolution,  they  appeared  determined  to  oppose  themselves  to  the  horrors  of  an  as assault,  sault, assault,  rather  than  voluntarily  submit  to  an  enemy  they  so  cordially  abhor.  Madrid  is  as  completely  untenable  as  London  ;  and  from  that  circumstance  we  are  able  to  fonn  some  ettianate  of  the  sentiments  with  which  the  Spaniards  are  in  pired  against  the  invaders.  Their  armies,  in  every  direction  have  been  dgfeAted  ;  and  thPir  minds,  so  far  from  sinking  into  pusillanimity  and  despondency,  display  more  energy  and  determination,in'proportion  as  the  progress  of  the  enemy  becomes  more  alarming,  and  their  success  more  decisive.  This  single  eirepustanceproves,  beyond  contra contradictiOn,  dictiOn, contradictiOn,  what  we  frequently  advanced,  that  the  tyrant  can  preteud  to  nq  greater  part  of  that  country,  than  what  is  oc occupied  cupied occupied  by  his  soldiery  the  remainder  is  as  completely  un unsubdued,  subdued, unsubdued,  and  as  ho4tile,  as  it  was  three  months  ago.  Every  impartial  account  from  the  Peninsula  continr4  this  opinion,  and  the  reverse  of  it  originated  solely  in  the  affected  alarms  and  the  misrepresentations  of  some  party-writers  here  at  home.  From  these  Bulletins,  partial  and  distorted  as  they  are,  there  is  sufficient  to  convince  us,  that  the  opposition  made  to  the  enemy  was  much  greater  than  they  are  willing  to  acknowledge.  This  glorious  spirit  of  resistance,  and  the  ungovernable  animosity  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  capital,  will  compell  the  Tyrant  to  employ  a  considerable  part  of  his  force  in  keeping  the  capital  in  awe,  In  every  other  great  town  he  occupies,  he  will  be  placed  under  a  similar  necessity  ;  anti  the  farther  he  advances,  the  more  cities  he  takes  posSession  of,  the  more  his  force  whill  be  divided.  This  we  always  anticipated,  and  considered  as  an  inevitable  consequence  of  his  first  success.  Under  such  restrictions,  it  is  totally  out  of  his  power  to  overawe,  at  the  same  time,  the  inhabitants  of  the  country,  and,  paradoxical  as  it  may  appear;  in  proportion  as  he  is  successful,  his  means  of  sub subjugating  jugating subjugating  the  country  become  weaker  adirmore  precarious.  '  He  has  had  an  opportunity  of  convincing  himself  of  this  truth  ;  and  his  miserable  expedient  of  sending  over  his  Bolictins  to  this  country,  in  the  intention,  as  he  has  the  in insolence  solence insolence  to  expect,  of  intimidating  our,  government,  and  damping  the  exertions  of  the  British  public,  is  an  unequi unequivocal  vocal unequivocal  proof  of  the  terror  he  entertains  from  a  vi4-orous  co cooperation  operation cooperation  on  our  part.  We  are  from  entertaining  that  despicable  opinion  of  the  understandings  and  hearts  of  the  present  Ministry,  as  to  think  they  could  be  duped  by  so  mean  an  artifice.  It  is•  only  necessary  to  place  before  their  eyes  that  artiele  of  the  French  Bulletin,  which  coldly  men mentions  tions mentions  the  massacre  of  sixteen  stragglers  belonging  to  the  British  Army,  to  make  them  adopt  the  solemn  and  irre irrevocable  vocable irrevocable  determination  to  employ  every  nano  and  resource  of  this  country  to  revenge  so  inhuman  an  outrage.  Not  a  moment  should  be  'deferred  for  the  execution  of  this  just  retaliation..  Every  thing  which,  honour,  love  of  their  country  and  an  'abhorrence  of  injustice  can  suggest,  must  now  call  on  them  to  redouble  their  exertions.

In  the  interim,  a  party  of  horse,  patroling  the  coast,  perceived  the  boat,  and  traced  the  sailors  to  the  above  house,  where  they  were  all  taken,  and  have  since  been  executed  as  spies,  and  their  bodies  exposed  on  gib gibbets,  bets, gibbets,  at  intervals  of  a  mile  apart,  along  the  Freneh  coast,  from  Cape  Grisnez  to  Boulogne.

SINGULARITY  IN  MGR  LIFX.—The  .mistress  of  an  ample  domain  and  family  mansion,  in  the  neighbourhood  of  :Blackheath,  is  considered  a  most  eccentric  character.  Her  benevolence  is  unbounded,  and  she  possesses  an  amiable  disposition  ;  but  she  imbibes  the  most  whimsical  ideas.  A  few  days  since,  she  imagined  that  the  Prince  of  Darkness  had  taken  his  abode  in  the  backs  of  certain  ancient  fatuity  chairs,  and,  in  order  to  serve  Satan  with  an  action  01  ejectment,  she  sent  for  a  carpenter,  and  compelled  him  in  her  presence,  to  reduce  the  chairs  to  stools.  The  backs  of  course  were  condemned  to  that  element  where  the  Satanic  enemy  is  supposed  to  reside.  This  Lady,  on  a  former  oc occasion,  casion, occasion,  received,  as  a  present,  a  most  beautiful  animal  of  the  horned  species,  brought  from  Peru.  She  was  extreme extremely  ly extremely  partial  to  it,  and  the  little  favourite  was  placed  on  the  awn  before  the  house,  where  its  tricks  and  appearance  de deighted  ighted deighted  the  family.  The  fond  mistress  having  one  day  eft  a  rose  which  she  had  plucked  in  the  garden,  on  the  -  steps  of  the  hall,  the  favourite  not  only  breathed  the  fra fragrance  grance fragrance  of  the  flower,  but  ate  the  damask  buds.  Before  he  _had  finished  his  repast  the  Lady  noticed  the  act,  and  she  immediately  turned  away  from  her  favourite,  and  would  never  see  it  again.  She  'entertained  an  idea  that  the  animal  had  violated  her  hospitality,  by  destroying  her  favourite  flower.  Many  other  instances  of  refined  singularity  have  •  distinguished  this  Lady  among  her  neighbours.  Mr.  Horne  Tooke  is  so  much  recovered  as  to  be  declared  by  his  physicians  able  to  weather  the  winter  in  point  of  physical  strength,  provided  his  mind  can  be  kept  riding  quietly  at  anchor,  and  not  suffered  to  adventure  any  more  on  the  political  ocean  I  A  new  plan  has  been  recently  suggested  for  enlarging  Smithfield  Market,  or  rather  for  rendering  the  present  space  adequate  to  the  transaction  of  the  increased  business  of  the  market.  It  is  proposed  to  remove  the  sheep  market  to  an  upper  story,  to  he  constructed  of  cast  iron,  over  the  present  space,  with  inclined  planes,  for  the  ascent  of  the  sheep,  and  that  the  whole  of  the'  space  beneath  should  be  used  as  a  market  for  horned  cattle.

Her  second  performance  of  Belvidera,  and  her  representation  of  Alicia,  have  enabled  us  to  form  a  juster  opinion  of  her  abilities.  They  arc  undoubtedly  great  ;  hut  checked  by  those  defects  Nye  have  so  lately  mentioned,  and  which  human  ingennit)  can  partly  conceal,  but  never  eradicate.  Her  jealous  scene  with  Hastings  was  not  ranting,  but  real  passion,  that  de derives  rives derives  all  its  strength  from  the  very  weakness  of  the  temalc  sex.  Her  madness  did  not  !consist  in  unnatural  screams  and  starts,  and  windmill-like  gesticulations;  it  contained  a  few  gleams  of  reason,  and  spread  a  faithful  and  melancholy  picture  of  passion,  triumphant  in  the  wreck  of  the  mind.  Miss  Norton,  in  all  her  speeches,  in  all  her  scenes,  was  true  to  nature  and  to  feeling.  The  mild  dignity,  rendered  more  affecting  by  her  self-contempt  and  humliation,  when  she  re4ists  Lord  Hastings'  passion  ;  her  spirit  bursting  through  all  the  considerations  of  prudence,  when  she  defends  the  cause  of  the  infant  king;  her  calm  resignaVon  when  her  sentence  is  pronounced;  and  the,  fervonr  with  which  shc  addresses  Heaven,  whilst  she  acknowledges  the  justice  •  of:  her  doom,  were  passages,  in  her  performance,  which  stamp  her  a  worthy  successor,  though,  as  yet,  far  from  an  equal,  to  the  British  Melpomene.  In  her  famished  scene,  her  grief  did  not  assume  the  wildness  of  ranting,  though  ex.  Airing  despair,  hut  always  preserved  the  same  dignified  character  of  cairn  resignation,  in  the  midst  of  sufferings  the  most  acute,  the  pangs  of  rejected  friendship,  still  severer  than  those  of  devouring  famine.  All  the  male  parts  in  this  tragedy  are  inferior  to  those  of  Jane  .‘:,'hore  and  and  do  not  open  a  wide  field  to  the  exertions  of  genius.  Mr.  C.  Kemble,  in  Lord  Hastings,  was  as  great  as  the  part  would  allow.  But  we  were  not  a  little  surprised  to  see  Mr.  Murray,  in  the  Duke  of  Gto'ster,  suddenly  start  to  an  unusual  degree  of  excellence.  He  has  •  always  been  justly  ranked  among  the  good  performers,  ou  whose  account  neitiwr  fame  nor  censure  strain  their  voice  :  but  on  Tte:rs.il  v  he  displayed  faithfully  and  spiritedly  the  treacliefous  him  - STYLE=superscript  loess  and  secret  ambition  of  the  cunning  Usurper,  especially  in  the  scene  in  which  he  tries  Lordfladings'  real  sentiments.

D'Egville  in  Crusle  displayed  as  much  sober  truth  of  action,  and  as  much  judgment,  as  in  his  performance  of  Caraetacus.

The  Loite  returned  the  charge,  undismayed  by  the  enemy's  superiority,  and  continued  a  sharp  action  of  half  an  hour  with  the  74.

This  extensive  and  deeply  projected  plan  of  commercial  and  political  interdiction  was  only  the  fore-runner  of  still  more  alarming  menaces  s  and  the  dock-yards  of  Europe  and  America  were  to  be  employed  in  constructing  fleets  to  transport  immense  armies  for  the  invasion  of  our  islands.  This  was  no  idle  threat  used  to  terrify  us  into  a  renunciation  of  our  maritime  preponderance;  it  was  the  favorite  and  maturely  weighed  object  of  an  individual,  whose  means  and  perseverance  arc  as  treat,  as  his  ambition  is  insatiable  ;  and  who,  in  addition  to  the  resentment  he  bears  us,  had  a  new  incite incitement  ment incitement  to  carry  it  into  execution,  from  the  conviction  he  felt,  that  as  long  as  this  country  retained  its  independence,  his  vast  projects  could  never  be  realised,  and  his  authority  was  precarious.  A  man,  animated  with  such  views,  and  acting  on  such  principles,  whose  moral  and  physical  resources  are  so  ex extensive,  tensive, extensive,  is  capable  of  pertimning  things,  which  to  the  generality  of  men  appear  incredible.  Ordinary  resistance,  at  least,  could  oppose  no  hindrance  to  his  profound  schemes;  nothing  but  the  most  strenuous  exertions  and  watchful  vigilance,  on  the  part  of  the  community,  were  sufficient  to  frustrate  them.  A  single  oversight,  or  relax relaxation  ation relaxation  on  our  part,  might  give  him  advantages,  which  all  the  combinations  of  genius,  and  the  efforts  of  patriotism  might  not  enable  us  to  wrest  from  him  ;  and  disasters  ensue  which  we  feel  a  horror  to  reflect  on.  Such  was  the  situation  we  stood  in  at  the  commence commencement  ment commencement  of  last  year.  We  have  given  a  faithful  description  of  the  dangers  we  were  exposed  to,  and  the  difficulties  we  had  to  surmount.  After  having  stated  them  candidly,  we  now  investigate  if  the  precautionary  measures  on  our  side  were  proportionate  to  their  alarming  extent.  It  is  by  frequent  and  impartial  examination  of  the  question  that  we  shall  be  able  to  meet  with  fortitude  any  occurrences  that  may  await  us,  and  prepare  the  means  of  rendering  them  harmless.  An  affected  delicacy  and  mysterions  silence  on  such  subjects  is  highly  reprehensible,  and  frequently  attended  by  the  most  dangerous  consequences  ;  for  what  interests  all  must  be  subject  to  public  and  unrestrained  investigation.  The  principal  object  that  engaged,  and  ought  to  engage,  the  attention  of  Government  at  that  time,  was  the  orga organization  nization organization  of  an  adequate  military  force.  This  was  the  subject  of  long  parliamentary  discussion  ;  and  the  public  coincided  in  the  necessity  of  increasing  our  army,  so  as  to  meet  the  exigency  of  the  moment.  However,  in  this  aug augmentation,  mentation, augmentation,  we  were  more  attentive  to  defensive  than  offen offensive  sive offensive  warfare;  and  were  not  sensible  of  the  insufficiency  of  such  a  measure,  until  the  unexpected  occurrences  in  Spain  convinced  us  of  the  error  we  had  committed.  In  politics,  nothing  is  more  dangerous  than  half  mea measures  sures measures  ;  and,  when  a  plan  is  adopted,  it  should  be  executed  to  the  fullest  extent  the  resources  of  a  country  admit  of.  The  very  moment  BONAPARTE  denounced  ruin  to  this  country,  had  we  immediately  embraced  the  resolution  of  retorting  on  France  the  vengeance  she  threatened  to  inflict  on  us,  instead  of  a  local  militia,  or  our  volunteer  system,  we  would  have  converted  the  whole  armed  force  of  the  fe-  le  regular  army,  ready  for  offensive  opportunity,  similar  to  that  which  offered  itself  to  display  the  vast  mistake  we  bad  been  guilty  of.—  JAN.  1.  Another,  far  more  fatal  in  its  tendency  and  consequences,  though  rejected  in  theory,  had  .been  invariably  adhered  to  in  practice,  since  the  beginning  of  the  revolutionary  war.  This  cousieed  in  the  pusiilauimous  policy  of  dis disclaiming  claiming disclaiming  the  practability  of  combating  the  enemy,  with  any  prospect  of  success,  on  his  own  territory.  The  mo moment  ment moment  this  idea  became  prevalent,  ras  long  as  it  continued  to  regulate  our  conduct,  we  gave  up  every  pretension  to  equality  ;  and  progressive  improvement,  or  political  ag aggrandizement,  grandizement, aggrandizement,  was  voluntarily  renounced.  It  is  a  truism,  in  political  science,  that  nothing  is  stationary;  and  the  community  which  cherishes  .the  idea,  that  it  has  arrived  at  the  zenith  of  its  power,  and  displayed  the  full  extent  of  its  resources,  inevitably  begins  to  decline,  and  will  do  so  sensibly,  till  it  has  discarded  this  dangerous  opinion.  The  energies  of  a  country  possessed  of  our  opulence,  popu population,  lation, population,  and  institutions  are  incalculable  ;  and,  the  states statesman  man statesman  who  does  not  think  so,  and  does  not  act  in  conformity  to  that  idea,  is  perfectly  incompetent  to  the  management  of  its  affairs.  What  has  been  observed  of  extraordinary  men,  is  perfectly  applicable  to  a  state  like  ours  :  that  nothing  is  impossible  to  them,  as  soon  as  they  form  the  determination  of  performing  it.  We  are  so  thoroughly  convinced  of  the  truth  of  this  observation,  that  we  feel  not  the  slightest  reluctance  in  ascribing  the  insufficient  part  we  acted,  for  the  last  fourteen  years,  solely  to  the  weakness  of  the  several  administrations.  We  recal  with  pleasure,  in  confirmation  of  what  we  have  asserted,  the  expression  of  a  much-lamented  Statesman  The  .

It  is  superfluous  to  mention  what  we  are  adverting  to  ;  and,  if  Ministers  possess  only  a  particle  of  genius;  with  sufficient  knowledge  of  the  British  character,  an  army  of  150,000  Englishmen  will  exhibit,  before  the  month  of  April  next,  what  Great  Britain  is  capable  of  performing.
