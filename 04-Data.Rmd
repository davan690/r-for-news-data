It's all very well being able to access the content, but for the purposes of the kind of things we'd like to do, access to the data is needed.

## JISC Newspaper digitisation projects
Maybe a separate chapter?

Most of the projects in the UK which have used newspaper data hvae been using the _British Libraryâ€™s 19th Century Newspapers_ collection. This is an interesting collection of content and worth outlining in some detail. Knowing the sources, geographical makeup and motivation behind the titles in the collection can be really helpful in thinking about what is and is not in the sources. 

The JISC newspaper digitisation program began in 2004, when The British Library received two million pounds from the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) to for some digitisation projects. A plan was made to digitise up to two million pages, across 49 titles (reference https://www.gale.com/intl/essays/ed-king-digitisation-of-british-newspapers-1800-1900). A second phase of the project digitised a further 22 titles. 

>The forty-eight titles chosen represent a very large cross-section of 19th century press and
publishing history. Three principles guided the work of the selection panel: firstly, that
newspapers from all over the UK would be represented in the database; in practice, this
meant selecting a significant regional or city title, from a large number of potential
candidate titles. Secondly, the whole of the nineteenth century would be covered; and
thirdly, that, once a newspaper title was selected, all of the issues available at the British
Library would be digitised. To maximise content, only the last timed edition was
digitised. No variant editions were included. Thirdly, once a newspaper was selected, all
of its run of issue would be digitised (Ed King)

This is all covered in lots of detail elsewhere, including some really interesting critiques of the access and so forth. But the overall makeup of it is clear, and this was a very specifically curated collection, though it was also influenced by contingency. 

Currently researchers access this either through Gale, or through the British Library as an external researcher. Many researchers have requested access to the collection through Gale, which they will apparently do in exchange for a fee for the costs of the hard drives and presumably some labour time. 

Some researchers have also got access to the collection through
