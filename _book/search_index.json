Once you get hold of it, the rewards can be huge: looking just at English-language users in the last few years, researchers have 2.1 Goals Hopefully, by the end of this book, you will have: Know what newspaper data is available, in what format, across a variety of countries and languages. Understand something of the various XML formats which make up most newspaper data sources Have been introduced to a number of tools which are particulalry useful for large-scale text mining of huge corpora: n-gram counters, topic modelling, text re-use. Including some specific to news, such as the R library Newsflow. Understand how the tools can be used to answer some basic historical questions (if not provide any answers) Historians have used newspaper data to do x and y. It can be used as a proxy for public opinion, used to study the movement and genesis of knowledge and information, help to understand the mix of private and public, how power can be advanced through news, and so forth. Some people might not even be interested in the news in its own right: What do you need in advance? Probably a mix of coding skills etc. 2.2 Format of the book - bookdown and github Will try and explain as much as possible, but will take shortcuts Not a programming expert, so it may not be optimised, the best of way doing things. It’s just the way I’ve found that works for me. Bookdown allows for code and figures directly in the text, like this: library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) a &lt;- c(10,20,30,40) b &lt;- c(&#39;book&#39;, &#39;pen&#39;, &#39;textbook&#39;, &#39;pencil_case&#39;) c &lt;- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) d &lt;- c(2.5, 8, 10, 7) df &lt;- data.frame(a,b,c,d) df %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = a, y = d, color = b), size = 5) Figure 2.1: plotting example There are bits of Python throughout, where I’ve only managed to work something out using that language. This is done using Reticulate, which allows for Python within R markdown. I hope I’ll be able to revise at some stage and do everything through one language. How did I write the book? In R-studio, bookdown and bibdesk ## Why R? Used to be idiosyncratic, is becoming very widely used by data scientist, digital humanities, social scientists. A lot of this is because of developers like Hadley Wickham and R studio - the tidyverse, but also data.table. 2.2.1 Who uses R? 2.2.2 The Tidyverse Historians using the language: Sharon Howard, Writing a book with such a specific goal is a bit of a weird proposition 2.3 Sources 2.3.1 Country by country 2.4 Methods 2.4.1 Network analysis of seventeenth century 2.4.2 Mapping 2.4.3 Geocoding 2.5 Text mining "],

The process is ongoing, digitising from microfilm and originals. Pages are segmented and OCRd, and can be full text searched. It is a commercial site and a fee is charged to access content away from BL reading rooms. Material from HMD newspaper digitisation project will most likely be added to the site. Added 6 million pages last year https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/ 28 million pages 450,000,000 (total physical collection) Access rights Free within the BL reading rooms, paid subscription off-site Features Download individual pages; OCR; segmentation; search; browse Example projects Content analysis of 150 years of British Periodicals; Victorian Meme Machine; Protest and the politics of space and place; Frederick Douglas in Britain; Scissors &amp; Paste; Oceanic Exchanges 3.2 Outside UK: 3.2.1 Chronicling America Library of Congress U.S Chronicling America is a Library of Congress initiative providing access to historic newspapers. Grants were given to participants to digitise approximately 100,000 newspaper pages each, which should represent “history, geographic coverage and events of note”. Mostly from microfilm for speed and cost. PDFs are available for download, full text search. CA has an API which allows for the creation of third party applications and sites using the bulk data. Good search functions but difficult to browse by date/region. More information here: https://oceanicexchanges.org/2018-10-17-data-reports-ca/ Between 1 - 2 million over the past 5 years, 3.3 million pages expected this year. https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/ 14 million pages (probably impossible to find total as it is a collection of individual State projects) JPEG2000 and PDF for download Free - no key needed for API OCR; segmentation; full text download; search; API Data Visualization: Journalism’s Journey West; An Epidemiology of Information: Data Mining the 1918 Influenza Epidemic; Bookworm; American Lynching; America’s Public Bible; Historical Agricultural News; Chronicling Hoosier; US News Map 3.2.2 Delpher Koninkklijke Bibliotheek Netherlands Delpher is the Netherland’s national media archive database.

Some are image or full text and other records are metadata only. 876,724 have had OCR processing. Newpapers can be browsed by date, country and title. Can be filtered by rights, which is useful. Images can be downloaded but users are directed back to the original source for more features. The plan is to tag up to 10 million pages with metadata and named entities. Difficult to tell - about 1,000 additional records tagged ‘newspaper’ were added in 2018. Currently available through http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers also https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/newspapers as part of the wider Europeana site. 4129989 newspapers Funding: European Union Multiple sources with different restrictions OCR; search; segmentation; bulk data download; metadata 3.2.5 Finnish Newspaper Database National Library of Finland Finland Newspapers; journals; maps; ephemera Finland’s national newspaper digitisation, run by the National Library of Finland. 7 million pages, 4 million of which are free to use and out of copyright.

Seems to run just from 1890 to 1939. http://zefys.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/index.php?id=start 3.2.20 Timarit.is Newspaper archive for Iceland, Greenland and Faroe Islands. Currently contains 1179 titles, 64683 articles, 5619584 pages (presumably the articles are low because it’s only counting ones that have been segmented successfully).

Can browse by title or search. Perhaps more functionality on various Google news apps https://news.google.com/newspapers 3.2.22 Baltic Digital Library Collection of digital objects, including newspapers. Some interesting features including structure (essentially allowing for browsing through titles/issues. 3.2.23 NewspaperSG Singapore’s national newspaper collection. Newspapers from 1831 onwards, plus a catelogue of the National Library’s microfilm holdings. Interesting ‘search terms visualiser’, essentially an N-Gram timeline, with up to five words at a time. Gives actual numbers rather than relative frequency, which isn’t very helpful if the material is not evenly spread out over the time. Also ‘this week in history’ and ‘most viewed articles’ sections. Search brings up OCR text first, rather than images. Cannot download full files 3.2.24 Svenska dagstidningar Partial Swedish Newspaper archive, containing over 500 titles, from 1645 to the present day. Material up until 1903 is freely available, anything after that only in the reading rooms of various Swedish libraries. https://tidningar.kb.se/ 500 titles 3.2.25 Handwritten Newspapers Project Archive of handwritten news from around the world. First issue is from 1700. Browsable by date. Some images but mostly links or catelogue records https://handwrittennews.com/ 3.2.26 The Medici Archive Project The Medici archive project consists of two parts: Building Interaction Archives (BIA) allows for the querying of manuscript documents, including handwritten news (avvisi). Some have full text transcriptions or English synopses. Documents can be compared via split screen, and there is some ability to browse or search named entities. The Medici Interactive Archive (MIA) is the second part, which intends to make the whole Medici archive available to researchers, including the ability to edit transcriptions, for example. http://www.medici.org/ "],
