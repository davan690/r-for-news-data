I  beg  leave  to  state  to  you,  for  the  information  of  my  Lords  Commissioners  of  the  Admiralty,  that  - STYLE=superscript  since  my  !al  letter  'of  the  6th  inst.

On  the  9th  a  party  of  eighty  infantry  and  four  cavalry,  under  the  command  of  three  officers  from  Pontivedra,  entered  Marin,  hut  a  fire  being  opened  on  them  from  this  ship,  and  the  Plover,  and  the  Carronade  from  the  launch,  they  made  i  a  most  precipi precipitate  tate precipitate  retreat  ;  the  commanding  officer  on  a  good  horse,  and  the  four  cavalry  benefiting  by  their  being  mounted,  left  their  com companions,  panions, companions,  who  outrunning  their  officers,  a  Captain  and  Lieute Lieutenant  nant Lieutenant  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  Spaniards,  who  delivered  them  to  me.
