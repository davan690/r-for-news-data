"THE  NATIONAL  REGISTER.  13  1  wish  that  Mr.  Hill's  ecclesiastical  lovalty  bore  any  pro proportion  portion proportion  to  his  political  allegiance  ;  that  he  reverenced  our  church,  as  as  much  he  respects  our  constitution.  lie  pray  heartily  for  his  King  and  Country  and  therefore  he  it'  estimated  by  the  criterion  trhich  King  George  the  Second  is  reported  to  have  applied  to  George  Whitfield,  a  good  and  true  subject  of  our  present  gracious  Sovereign.  His  prayers  have  another  merit.  As  he  is  an  extemporary  prayer,  as  well  as  preacher,  he  uniformly  avails  himself  of  topics  immediately  interesting  to  the  feelings  of  the  public.  When  he  prayed  for  Britain,  he  did  not  forget  to  intercede  for  Spain.  His  catholicism  only  requires  to  he  extended  to  the  ministers  of  our  national  church.  Most  devoutly  it  is  to  be  wished,  that  the  Hey.  Rowland  11111  would  entirely  commit  the  business  of  abusing  our  spiri spiritual  tual spiritual  dignitaries  to  William  Huntington.  Let  this  part  of  the  evangelical  occupation  be  forthwith  transferred  from  Surry  Chapel,  to  Providence  Chapel!  Leave  to  the  illite illiterate  rate illiterate  and  illiberal,  the  Huntingtons  or  Cobbetts  of  their  age,  the  disgraceful  task  of  reviling  those  qualifications  and  dignities  which  they  despair  of  attaining  themselves.  Vanity  ;  1  fear,  mingles  too  much  with  the  best  of  our  bestuesses.  What  other  sentiment  than  that  of  vanity  induced  Mr.  Hill  to  patronise  prints  of  his  own  hcuses,  where  he  is  represented  as  in  the  act  of  setting  out  front  home  in  his  full  robes,  while  a  medallion  profile  of  him  is  suspended  amidst  the  clouds  above?  Evangelical  minis,  tors,  it  should  seem,  arc  sometimes  rather  earthly  minded.  December  31i  1808.  OSCS/  MILS%"
