"THE  NATIONAL  IMGISTER.  Why  did  not  Mr.  Elliston  contrive  to  appear,  on  this  night,  in  phopria  persona'?  Certainly  he  might  have  delivered  some  species  of  introdoctory  prologue,  instead  bf  the  pantotnimical  prologue  which  was  recited;  without,  as  we  think,  any  degra:  dation  df  his  dramatic  char:Atter.  Let  him  not  slight  this  hint.  Shrfuld  it  he  found  that,  While  he  does  not  disdain  to  solicit  the  public  cash,  he  cannot  condescend  to  consult  the  public  whim,  reccipti  of  the  Royal  Circus  will  soon  whew  him  the  effect  of  popular  opi9ion.

I  Are  not  these  pests  admitted  'nosily  by  orders,  and  by  orders  only  THEsrit."
