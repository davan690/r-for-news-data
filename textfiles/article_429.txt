"TO  OWL  SUBSCRIBI,II';  AND  TIIE  PUBLIC.  The  Proprietors  of  THE  Ni  ATIO:4  AL  REGlstrit  beg  1  aye  to  inftwm  their  Subscribers,  that  the  proposed  rise  of  One  Penny  in  in  the  price  of  their  Paper  takes  place  to-lay.  The  reasons  they  have  assigned  for  this  augmentation,  they  confidently  hope,  will  be  found  unobjectionable.  They  have  resorted  to  it  as  a  matter  of  indispensible  necessity,  become  every  day  more  urgent  in  conseque4ce  of  the  excessive  increase  In  the  Price  of  Paper,  and  from  a  combination  of  other  circumstances.  They  were  reduced  to  the  alternative—to  diminish  the  Original  Matter,  and,  by  that  means.  decrease  their  own  expences  ;—or  resort  to  the  expedient  they  have  now  adopted.  After  the-  mnturest  con  siderat  ion,  they  adhered  to  the  latter  as  the  pref:rabl4  'mode  ;  and  in  a  moment  when  so  many  momentous  subjects  of  Foreign  and  Domestic  Disquisition  accumulate,  they  would  feel  the  most  sensible  regret,  were  any  relaxation  of  this  kind  to  appear  in  TIIL  NATIONAL  REGISTER.  They  have  incessantly  and  un unremittingly  remittingly unremittingly  laboured  to  merit  the  approbation  of  the  Public;  limit  Ernst  their  exertions  to  that  effect  hare  not  been  ineffectual.  fa  laying  new  claims  to  the  liberality  of  their  Readers,  they  consequently  impose  on  themselves  new  obligations  to  justify  these  pretensions.
