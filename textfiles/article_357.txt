Mover  to  persist  ill  his  motion  before  the  great  question  respecting  the  conduct  of  the  Duke  of  York  should  be  determine.  He  really  thought  that  any  selection  of  witnesses  for  punishment  before  the  decision  upon  the  conduct  of  the  Duke  of  York,  as  calculated  to  displease  the  public,  and  seem  partial  in  the  eyes  of  the  people,  in  proportion  as  their  testimony  was  more  or  less  favourable  to  their  own  views.

The  debate  was  ad adjourned  journed adjourned  to  Tuesday  se'nnight."
