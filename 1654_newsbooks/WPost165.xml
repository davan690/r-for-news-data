<p>From France our POST bringeth us intelligence that the Duke of York is recovered of his sickness; and that his brother Charles is very active; but alas! poor &mdash;, to little purpose: the stream runs current, who dares interpose? for my part I dare not, neither <reg orig="wil">will</reg> I: therefore, <i>God speed the Plough.</i></p>

<p>And the Lord protect Us: A glorious, peaceable, and happy Government, who questions, but that we shall enjoy under his Highness: For, observe the Dream of Mr. <reg orig="Ienkins">Jenkins</reg> in Windsor Castle, on Tuesday night last, to wit, That God will stain the pride of all glory, and bring down the mighty Ones on Earth.</p>

<p>The Highlanders grow numerous in Scotland; and the Tories are too potent in Ireland. They have had several <reg orig="Randevouzes">Rendezvous</reg>; and sundry time made incursions upon the Lowlanders. But care is taken to prevent the like for the future, if we can. The King of Scots has sent Letters to them, promising aid and assistance. But alas! fair words butter no Parsnips.</p>

<p>The English fleet rides still about St. <reg orig="Hellens">Hellen's</reg> Point; but the Dutch are not yet forth. There has been a great <reg orig="shipwrack">shipwreck</reg> upon the Coast of <pb n="3" />France, and divers men drowned. The English fleet from the Straits, Spain, Portugal, and Biscain, are also come safe into the River of Thames, and several Dutch Prizes also. Ten more are expected every Tide. The last Post from France advertiseth, that King Lewis and his Council have agreed to send an Ambassador Extraordinary unto his Highness the Lord Protector.</p>

<head level="3"><i>men, and Citizens, against his Highness the</i></head>

<head level="3"><i>Lord Protector, &amp;c.</i></head>

<p>On Tuesday last, being the 13 of this instant Feb. a company of Gentlemen at Mr. Amps at the Ship-Tavern in the Old-<reg orig="Bayley">Bailey</reg>, and being drinking two pair of stairs high, and having called for as much Sack as come to eight shillings and six pence, before they had put a period to their quaffing Glasses, in came Lieu. Colonel Woosley, and divers other Officers and <reg orig="Souldiers">Soldiers</reg> (having notice of their Design and Meeting by one of the four appointed to receive instructions from the King of Scots) with their Swords and Pistols <reg orig="cockt">cocked</reg>, and went <reg orig="immediatly">immediately</reg> up <reg orig="staires">stairs</reg>, where they demanded the Names of the Persons, their Residence, and their present business; which they answered: But it being not <em>satisfactory</em>: the Officers told them, they had an Order from his Highness to apprehend, and commit them to custody, during the pleasure of his Highness: Whereupon the <em>Drawers</em> were all called up, and examined, <i>Whether knew not one face there, except M. <em>Dutton's</em></i>. Whereupon they secured them all, and conducted them to <em>James's</em>; upon the <em>Ordinance</em> for <em>Treason</em>, for contriving and conspiring against his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg> the Lord Protector. And <reg orig="withall">withal</reg>, took away Mr. <em>Amps</em> the Master of the house; but upon examination, he was acquitted. And upon Thursday last they were all brought to their <reg orig="Tryal">Trial</reg> before the <reg orig="Councel">Council</reg> at <reg orig="White-hal">Whitehall</reg>, where <reg orig="som">some</reg> of them confessed, and laid open the whole Design: the manner whereof was as followeth: 1 That an Oath of <reg orig="Secresid">Secrecy</reg> should be given to all to whom it should be revealed, which accordingly was done; and none was made privy to <reg orig="any thing">anything</reg> of it, before he first took the Oath. 2 That the design should be <reg orig="carryed">carried</reg> on in the management <pb n="4" />thereof, by such as should be faithful friends to their King. 3 That so many persons should be engaged for Officers to an Army, as should undertake for the private listing of 30000 men to be ready to rise at a time appointed. 4 That at the said time wherein they should so rise, that they should fall on to act what was designed in all the <reg orig="severall">several</reg> Counties, and parts of England at once. 5 That one party should fall at that time the Lord Protector, to murder him and his Life-guard, and those Officers and others that should be about him: And they had two <reg orig="dayes">days</reg> debate, whether they should fall upon his Highness at that time when he dined in the city of London, and murder him, and those him with then; but it was resolved in the Negative, because <em>Ch. Stuart</em> was not in England, nor their forces ready in other parts of England. 6 That at the same time another party <reg orig="shold">should</reg> have seized on the Council at <reg orig="White-hall">Whitehall</reg>, and have murdered them and their Attendants. 7 That the Garrison at <reg orig="Iameses">James's</reg> should also be the same time seized on, and the <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg> surprised in their quarters there, and at <reg orig="White-hall">Whitehall</reg>, and all put to the sword that opposed. 8 That a strong party <reg orig="shold">should</reg> at the same time <reg orig="seiz">seize</reg> upon the Lieutenant of the Tower, the <reg orig="souldier">soldier</reg>, take possession, and let out the prisoners. 9 That at this time their King should be ready private in a place of the city of London, and be brought forth, and presently crowned, and proclaimed King, and have the Government put into their hands by them, and all that should oppose, to <reg orig="dye">die</reg> without mercy. 10 That at the same time parties should <reg orig="seiz">seize</reg> upon all the several Guards and <reg orig="Garisons">Garrisons</reg> in England. 11 That Proclamations should have been sent out to all parts of England, that <em>Ch. Stuart</em> was crowned King, and received into the city, offering pardon unto all that would come in, and comply with them.</p>

<p>From Holland it is further certified, that the United Provinces have brought in their Ratification to the Articles for Peace, and that they have both signed and sealed <reg orig="ingeneral">in general</reg>; and are preparing of an Ambassador to be sent unto his Highness the Lord Protector, for the confirming thereof: It is said the Lord Updam is the man elected: But of this, more in my next.</p>

<head level="3"><i>Mr. <em>Evans</em> interpretation upon Mr. <em><reg orig="Farleys">Farley's</reg></em> bloody Vision.</i></head>

<p>Whereas you saw <reg orig="your self">yourself</reg> standing upon stone steps in London, it signifies the firmness thereof. And whereas you saw a Coach with a Woman in it all clothed in scarlet passing by, signifies a bloody enemy that will suddenly vanish away and be consumed. And whereas you saw six youths all in blue, they <reg orig="signifie">signify</reg> Charles his Wain, and their <reg orig="Voyce">Voice</reg> which said; Behold, take notice of the Moon, signifies the Comet or Blazing Star, which Star signified the dissolution of the late power. And whereas you saw a <reg orig="sign post">signpost</reg> with the sign of the Moon to it, and of the spot of blood that appeared upon it, and overspread both it and the sky; by the sign of the Moon is signified the multiplicity of Divisions. And whereas you saw a man sitting by the picture of the Moon with the light like a candle in his hand, and another man coming to him with a candle unlighted, signifies the issuing forth Commissions by an eminent Commander for aid and assistance. And whereas you saw a Chariot with milk-white horses coming out of a Court, and the Chariot of fire, signifies a violent interest to be set up, so that all will in that day be forced to shut up their shop windows and doors for fear, so that he which is without <reg orig="doores">doors</reg> <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> not <reg orig="finde">find</reg> a place wherein to hide his head, but the violating of Tyranny restores us to our former pristine liberty.</p>

<head level="3"><i>The interpretation of the second Vision.</i></head>

<p>Then said I, whereas you saw <reg orig="your self">yourself</reg> in a field newly sown with Wheat; that signifies a new Government to be established in <reg orig="Brittain">Britain</reg>, that is, the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, more glorious <reg orig="then">than</reg> ever was upon earth. And whereas you saw a company of milk Doves upon that field, all in a round Ring, or circle: The Ring, or Circle, signifies the endless, everlasting, and everstanding Court that <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> be established. And the company of milk white Doves signifies the spotless Saints that have continued faithful <pb n="6" />to his Highness. Therefore they and their seed <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> <reg orig="tryumph">triumph</reg> gloriously for ever. And whereas you saw one Dove alone in the middle of the Ring, or Circle, which did shine like the Sun in brightness; by that Dove is signified his Highness, who in due time will shine like the Sun over all the earth, to answer the expectation of all Nations, and <reg orig="fulfill">fulfil</reg> the promise of our Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>The King of Scots is now going for Germany: from whence our Scout bringeth intelligence, that the Emperor is coming down by land against the Hollander, requiring restitution for several injuries by them committed.</p>

<p>Ma. Gen. <em>Middleton</em> is gone for the North of Scotland with about two hundred Cavaliers, he was transported by 7 ships from Holland, and <reg orig="carryed">carried</reg> some Arms and Ammunition. Ha, ha, ha! I smell a Rat: pick Dutch spregne out of that.</p>
