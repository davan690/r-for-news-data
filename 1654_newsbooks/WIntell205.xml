<p>This morning <reg orig="severall">several</reg> letters were received intimating that the Peace was concluded with <em>England</em>, two of the Provinces, that of <em>Gilderland</em>, and the other of <em><reg orig="Groninghen">Groningen</reg></em> standing off for the present, and neither denying, nor admitting it; it is said that on the day following these two Provinces concurred with the other for the Ratification of the Peace, this is good news indeed, however I cannot yet hear of any Letters from the States General to confirm it.</p>

<p>It is true that the Lord <em>Beverling</em> hath had Audience by his Highness, and it is said, that as a plenipotentiary, he hath received <reg orig="ful">full</reg> power, and Instructions to conclude the Peace, but why is not the Peace then ratified, until the other Ambassadors are come, who indeed are daily expected, but for the present we can hear nothing of the arrival of them.</p>

<p>In the mean time to please the people in <em>Holland</em>, who are now as loud for peace, as they were heretofore for War, there <pb n="1" />hath been printed this Extract at <em>Amsterdam</em>, concerning both the quality, and the number of the Articles of Peace between the <reg orig="Common.wealth">Commonwealth</reg> of <em>England</em>, and the United Provinces of the Low Countries.</p>

<p>1 That there shall be a safe and sure Peace between both Nations.</p>

<p>2 That there from hence forth all hostility shall cease.</p>

<p>3 That all wrongs and offences suffered either by the one or other party shall be forgotten; and neither party shall pretend any thing thereupon. All actions past shall be nulled, except those that shall be done in the <em><reg orig="Brittish">British</reg></em> Seas after the time of 12. <reg orig="dayes">days</reg>, and from that Sea to the Cape of Saint <em>Vincent</em> in the time of six weeks, and from thence in the <reg orig="Mediterranian">Mediterranean</reg> Sea, as far as the line after the time of ten weeks; and at the other side of the line in the time of eight <reg orig="moneths">months</reg> to be reckoned from the time of publication of the Peace, and all Prizes taken after that time shall be restored.</p>

<p>4 That all the Prisoners on both sides be released without ransom.</p>

<p>5 That both <reg orig="Common-wealths">Commonwealths</reg> shall be confederate friends to defend one the other against whomsoever.</p>

<p>That neither of both shall act against the other, either by Land or by Sea.</p>

<p>7 That the States shall cause restitution to be made of all the ships and goods seized upon the English by the King of <em>Denmark</em> that are yet in being, as also a full compensation of the worth of those goods that may be sold already, and likewise that all the damages or spoil of goods shall be made good to the owners, by estimation, and when such satisfaction shall be done by the said King, then all hostility shall cease between <em>England</em> and <em>Denmark</em>.</p>

<p>8 That no inhabitants of either <reg orig="Common.wealth">Commonwealth</reg> shall assist any Rebel of either with money, ships or victuals.</p>

<p>9 That both <reg orig="Common.wealths">Commonwealths</reg> shall assist one the other at their proper charges against their Rebels.</p>

<p>10 That neither shall receive those that are, or shall be declared open enemies of either <reg orig="Common.wealth">Commonwealth</reg>.</p><pb n="2" />

<p>11 That either <reg orig="Common.wealth">Commonwealth</reg> having notice by the other that some of the enemies are in its Dominions; they shall give them warning to depart in 28 <reg orig="dayes">days</reg> upon pain of death.</p>

<p>12 That the States shall not suffer any of the Inhabitants of their Dominions to assist the Enemies of <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>13 That the English shall not pay greater Impositions <reg orig="then">than</reg> other Nations.</p>

<p>14 That the <reg orig="States">States'</reg> ships shall strike their <reg orig="Flagg">Flag</reg> before the English in the <em><reg orig="Brittish">British</reg></em> Seas.</p>

<p>15 That neither of the <reg orig="Common-wealths">Commonwealths</reg> shall give retreat to any <em><reg orig="Pyrats">Pirates</reg></em> in any of their Ports.</p>

<p>16 That in case the English or the Dutch make any Treaty with any Prince; they shall therein comprehend each other reciprocally, if they desire it.</p>

<p>17 That in case some hostility should happen between the Inhabitants of both <reg orig="Common wealths">Commonwealths</reg>, by one against the other, That the allowance shall nevertheless, hold and remain in full force, and the parties that shall be found guilty shall be punished.</p>

<p>18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 are not so much considerable.</p>

<p>25 That if one party shall cause some damages to the other, there shall be no Letters of Reprisal given, But if in three months time, no satisfaction is done, then the said Letters may be granted.</p>

<p>26 is not so much considerable.</p>

<p>27 That no more but eight ships of War shall be suffered to come or remain in the Ports of each <reg orig="others">other's</reg> <reg orig="Common-wealth">Commonwealth</reg> at one time: And when there shall be occasion for a greater number, then the consent must be first asked.</p>

And if the Commissioners cannot agree thereupon <pb n="3" />within the time of three <reg orig="moneths">months</reg>. Then the aforesaid differences to be referred to the Judgment of the Protestant <em>Switzers</em>.</p>

<p>You may remember I made mention in my last of some ships sent from <em>Holland</em> with Arms from <em>Scotland</em>. It is since confirmed, that seven ships in which were <reg orig="imbarked">embarked</reg> 200 Soldiers, and a very considerable quantity of Arms, are arrived in the North of <em>Scotland</em>.</p>

<head level="3"><em>Thursday</em>, Febr: 17.</head>

<p>There was this day the Report of a great plot discovered at the Ship-tavern in the <em>Old <reg orig="Baily">Bailey</reg></em>, in which are said to be Captain <em>Smith</em>, Mr. <em>Dutton</em>, and the Son of Alderman <em>Bunch</em> <pb n="4" />whose Father is in the <em>Netherlands</em>. It is certain that divers were this day apprehended, and some others the last night, at what time the Vintner himself, whose name is Mr. <em>Amps</em>, was secured. The business being yet under examination, I shall refer for your satisfaction to the last page of this <em>Intelligence</em>.</p>

<p>We had Letters from <em>Scotland</em>, advertising the death of Col: <em>Wogan</em>, who died in the Castle of <em>Weims</em> on the 8th of this present month, he was buried at <em>Kenmore</em>, the Lord of <em>Kenmore</em> himself being present at his funeral. It is said that some of the <em>Scots</em> in the Western Clans have made overtures to Cap: <em>Hill</em> for Passes to come in unto the <em>English</em> to be protected by them; which Passes being sent to our Commander in <reg orig="cheif">chief</reg> it was held at a <reg orig="Councel">Council</reg> of Warvery convenient that they should be granted.</p>

<p>There is a strange thing reported of an Assassinate in <em>Selesia</em> in <em>Germany</em>, who is said to have wilfully <reg orig="imbrewed">imbrued</reg> his hands in the <reg orig="bloud">blood</reg> of one hundred and eighty persons, besides those whose fortune it was to fall under his Sword in the time of the War, this he confessed himself before the Court of Justice, and seemed not to be ashamed at the <reg orig="Rubrick">Rubric</reg> of the <reg orig="Arithmetick">Arithmetic</reg>, wherefore the Court of Justice commanded that his hands and feet should be cut off whiles he was yet alive, and his <reg orig="brests">breasts</reg> pinched with burning irons, and that afterwards for a <reg orig="publick">public</reg> terror, he should be brought in a cage upon the Scaffold, where he was broken upon the wheel, he endured the pain without the least crying out, or without altering his countenance at all, his <reg orig="dismembred">dismembered</reg> body was set on poles to be an example to all from committing such like <reg orig="bloudy">bloody</reg> cruelties.</p>

<p>We have little as yet from <em>Sweden</em>, in relation to the proceedings of the Negotiation of our Ambassador for a stricter <reg orig="allyance">alliance</reg> with that Crown. It is said that there are great preparations for War, the like to which was never seen in that Nation, they are preparing to have in a <reg orig="readines">readiness</reg> twenty thousand Foot, and ten thousand Horse, the design being concealed very closely.</p><pb n="5" />

<p>There is a Report that the <em>Lorraigners</em> with his adjunct the Prince of <em>Conde</em> have ruined all in the <reg orig="Bishopprick">Bishopric</reg> of <em>Leige</em>, on the Borders where the Prince of <em>Conde</em> hath taken and <reg orig="plundred">plundered</reg> the Town of <em>Binar</em>; the Emperor, and the Elector of <em>Collen</em> have sent several Troops to oppose their potent plunderers. The young Princess of <em>Holland</em> is gone with her young Son from the <em>Hague</em>, to keep the Court at <em>Breda</em>, understanding that the Provinces are all assembled to conclude a peace with the <reg orig="Common-wealth">Commonwealth</reg> of England.</p> 

<p>It is affirmed from <em>Monmouthshire</em> not far from <em>Ragland</em> Castle on the fixt of this <reg orig="moneth">month</reg> there hath been seen an Apple tree which hath had green leaves, buds and young apples, and this is accounted a great wonder in <em>Wales</em>. Why, since Christmas I have seen in <em>London</em> a Girl do as much, of not fifteen years of Age.</p>

<head level="3"><em>Friday</em>, Febr: 17.</head>

<p>It is advertised from <em>Scotland</em>, that several parties of the Enemies falling down into the <em>Lowlands</em> in several parties have been taken by our Forces; four of <em><reg orig="Glencarns">Glencarn's</reg></em> own Troop have been taken, and eight Horse, his Lieutenant, whose Name is <em>Rutherford</em> hardly escaped.</p>

<p>But four of <reg orig="Collonel">Colonel</reg> <em><reg orig="Twistletons">Twistleton's</reg></em> Regiment, and two of <reg orig="Collonel">Colonel</reg> <reg orig="Okeyes">Okey's</reg> marching from <em>Drummond</em> Castle, to Saint <reg orig="Johnstons">Johnstone</reg>. were set upon by some of Sir <em>Arthur Forbs</em>, and <em><reg orig="Wogans">Wogan's</reg></em> Horse, who although he himself is dead, yet some of his number do disperse themselves up and down the Country, and commit great <reg orig="Roberies">Robberies</reg>. Our men seeing but eight of the Enemy at the first, did make gallant resistance, but the whole Troop appearing, they were <reg orig="overpowred">overpowered</reg> by numbers, two of them were slain outright, and three taken Prisoners, being sorely wounded.</p>

<p>There are a considerable party of the <em>Highlanders</em> not far from Saint <em><reg orig="Johnstons">Johnstone</reg></em>, who are very active since the drawing of our Horse Northwards, but upon the coming of two Regiments more from <em>England</em>, our Horse will be so disposed of, that the <em>Highlanders</em> will be met with in all places; it being impossible for them to move in the <em>Lowlands</em>, but we shall be<pb n="6" />at their heels to pursue them, or in the front to oppose them.</p>

<p>It is advertised, that Coll: <em>Drummond</em> is for certain arrived with further Instructions from the titular King of the <em>Scots</em>, &amp; to return advertisements unto him in what strength they are, and whether they mare able to make an Army fitting for himself to lead into the <reg orig="Feild">Field</reg>. But as the numbers of the <em>Highlanders</em> begin to decrease, so doth their courage, 10000 of the Arms, with other Ammunition and utensils of War, being sunk with the ship that brought them on the coasts of <em>Scotland</em>.</p>

<head level="3"><em>Saturday</em>, Febr: 18.</head>

<p>The Tories who began to make a new bustling in <em>Ireland</em>, finding it impossible to subsist in their <reg orig="consumaciousness">contumaciousness</reg> have submitted; and having <reg orig="layed">laid</reg> down their Arms are to be transported into <em>Flanders</em> for the service of the King of <em><reg orig="Spaine">Spain</reg></em>.</p>

<p>I made mention before of several persons apprehended by Lieutenant Coll: <em><reg orig="Charls">Charles</reg> Worsley</em>, and some other Officers upon a plot against the Lord Protector. It is said, that some of them being examined, have confessed that they had all taken an Oath of <reg orig="secrecie">secrecy</reg> and fidelity amongst themselves. They had agreed upon a certain number of Commanders and Officers that should raise and lead an Army of thirty thousand men, which being distributed into <reg orig="severall">several</reg> places of the Nation, should at one time <reg orig="seiz">seize</reg>-upon the person of his Highness, and his Life-guard, and the Council at <em>Whitehall</em>, and the Tower of <em>London</em>, and on all the Garrisons of this Nation; which being done, the titular King of the <em>Scots</em> who (it is said) was for that purpose to <reg orig="lye">lie</reg> obscure in some place of this City, should suddenly appear and <reg orig="shew">show</reg> himself, and be proclaimed King, offering pardon unto all. It is further said, that to give more credit to the plot, it should be noised abroad, that it was all carried on and managed by the Cavaliers, thinking under that notion that they should raise a greater number to <reg orig="joyn">join</reg> with them. Those that were apprehended were this day examined by the Council, and afterwards committed to close imprisonment as well they deserved: their names are,</p><pb n="7" />

<p>The Names of the chief conspirators.</p>

<p><em>Thomas Bunch.</em>	Captain <em>Smith</em>.</p>
<p><em>Thomas Durton.		John Archer</em>.</p>
<p><em>William Jenkins		Joseph Parker</em>.</p>
<p>Roger <em>Leigh.		Thomas <reg orig="Rosse">Ross</reg></em>.</p>
<p><em>Christopher Watkins.	Peter Middleton</em>.</p>
<p><em>Joseph Sawyer.		Roger <reg orig="Cotes">Coates</reg></em>.</p>

<head level="3"><em>Monday</em>, Febr: 20.</head>

<p>More of the Conspirators were this Day apprehended, of whom, and of the furthest examination of them, and their <reg orig="confederats">confederates</reg> we shall give you a further account in our next.</p>

<p>This day came forth an Act in explication of the former Act concerning Treason: I am informed that the titular Scotch King sent lately unto <em>Holland</em>, desiring the transportation of some thousands of <reg orig="Souldiers">Soldiers</reg> and Officers which he had got together: And that from thence a Dispatch <reg orig="immediatly">immediately</reg> was made to the King of <em>Denmark</em> to see what Assistance he could get there. The Scots continue their <reg orig="plundrings">plunderings</reg> in parties, and oftentimes fall short of home. It is advertised, that it is impossible for the <em>Highlanders</em> to have any considerable Body of Horse in the field <reg orig="untill">until</reg> the middle of May.</p>

<p>The expected Ambassadors from <em>Holland</em> are not yet arrived. Our fleet consisting of fourscore and eight gallant ships, are put forth to Sea; The <em><reg orig="Soveraign">Sovereign</reg></em> is making ready with all possible speed at <em>Portsmouth</em>; so are the <em>Rainbow</em>, the <em>Resolution</em>, and the <em>Andrew</em> at <em>Chatham</em>. Several prizes are brought in, some belonging to <em>France</em>, and some to <em>Holland</em>.</p>

<p>Mr: <em>Feake</em>, and Mr: <em>Powel</em> have made Addresses for their liberty. The Brother to the <em>Portugal</em> Ambassador is this week to be <reg orig="tryed">tried</reg> at the <em>Old <reg orig="Baily">Bailey</reg></em>. It is said that Major General <em>Brown</em> will be suddenly released from his captivity in <em>Ludlow</em> Castle.</p>

<p>That which this week is most remarkable, is:</p>

<p><i>The Examination and Confession of the Conspirators committed close prisoners to the Tower. Their Design to have surprised the person of his Highness, his <reg orig="Life:guard">Lifeguard</reg>, and his Council, and at once to have seized upon the Tower of <em>London</em>, the Garrison at St: <em><reg orig="Jameses">James's</reg></em> and all the Garrisons in this Nation: as also to have raised an Army of thirty thousand Horse and Foot, and to have crowned the titular King of <em>Scots</em> The address of the titular King of the Scots to <em>Holland</em> and <em>Denmark</em> for their assistance, and the transportation of <reg orig="foure">four</reg> thousand Officers and Soldiers into <em>Scotland</em>. The drowning of his Ship laden with Arms and Ammunition. Our Fleet of fourscore and eight Sail put forth to Sea Divers prizes sent in. More of the Confederates apprehended: And the hopes of the <reg orig="Inlargements">Enlargements</reg> of Major Gen: <em>Brown</em> from <em>Ludlow</em> Castle.</i></p>
