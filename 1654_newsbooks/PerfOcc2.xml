<p>Imprinted at London, for <em>G. Horton</em>, 1654.</p>

<p>Major Gen. <em>Brown</em> is returned from his Captivity in <em>Wales</em>, to his house in <em>London</em>, and divers others are <reg orig="restoree">restored</reg> to their liberty by his Highness. The Highlanders have received a great Defeat in <em>Scotland</em>; but Gen. <em>Glencarn</em> hath set forth a <em>Proclamation</em> to promote his titular <reg orig="Majesties">Majesty's</reg> service against <em>England</em>, with this inscription.</p>

<p><i>God save King <em>CHARLES</em> the Second.</i></p><pb n="1" />

<p>His Highness the Lord Protector and his <reg orig="honorable">honourable</reg> Council have set forth an Ordinance of explanation touching Treasons; a Copy whereof followeth:</p>

<p>Whereas by an Ordinance, <reg orig="entituled">entitled</reg>, <i>An Ordinance declaring that the offences therein mentioned, and no other, <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> be adjudged high treason within the Commonwealth of <em>England, Scotland</em>, and <em>Ireland</em>,</i>, it is amongst other things ordained and established, that no matter, fact, crime, or offence whatsoever, other <reg orig="then">than</reg> such as are therein mentioned and expressed, should be deemed, taken or adjudged to be high-treason; And whereas some doubts and question may arise, whether that clause in the said Ordinance doth not extend to the offences mentioned in the Instrument, <reg orig="entituled">entitled</reg>, The Government of the <reg orig="Common-wealth">Commonwealth</reg> of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and which are thereby declared to be high Treason; For clearing thereof, and removing all scruples thereupon, his Highness the Lord Protector, by and with the advice of his Council, doth declare and ordain, that neither the said Ordinance, nor any clause or thing therein contained, <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> extend or be construed, adjudged or taken to extend unto all or any the offences declared by the said Instrument to be high treason, but that all and every the said Offences are hereby adjudged to be high treason, and that all and every the <reg orig="Offendors">Offenders</reg> shall suffer the penalties of <reg orig="Hightreason">High treason</reg>, the said Ordinance, or <reg orig="any thing">anything</reg> therein contained to the contrary, in any wise notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Major Gen. Harrison is going for <reg orig="Stafford-shire">Staffordshire</reg>, and intends to betake himself to a private course of life. Alas poor Gentleman! I wish all men would rather expose themselves to the Countrey <reg orig="Ayr">Air</reg>, <reg orig="then">than</reg> to be restrained (by<pb n="2" /> their contempt of magistracy) either in a Prison or tower though notwithstanding Mr. Feak, and Mr. Simpson remains still at Windsor Castle; and not long since declared, that they never found more inward comforts, and spiritual solacings, in the time of their freedom, <reg orig="then">than</reg> they now do in their tribulation. And Mr. Rogers declares it a part of his duty, as touching his Ministry, to speak concerning the Revolutions and present Occurrences of the times.</p>

<p>From France our Occurrences advertiseth, That the Prince of Conde has taken the strong <reg orig="Garison">Garrison</reg> of Dinan, and ransacked the famous town for their loyalty to the King and Crown.</p>

<p>From Windsor we have received intelligence, that Mr. <em>Feak</em> and Mr. <em>Simpson</em> have sent up a Declaration and Letter to his Highness, (by way of Address) wherein they implore their liberty. This, to me, seems <reg orig="somthing">something</reg> strange: therefore, by my next, I shall make a further enquiry into the truth thereof.</p>

<p>This day came piping-hot News from Tower-hill, that the King of Scots was landed in the North of Scotland; which to me <reg orig="seemes">seems</reg> as true as his Residence in London, at the time when the aforesaid Conspirators were apprehended in the <reg orig="Old-Bayley">Old Bailey</reg>.</p>

<p>The English fleet rides still, about St. <reg orig="Hellens">Helens</reg> Point; but the Dutch are not yet forth. There has been a great <reg orig="shipwrack">shipwreck</reg> upon the Coast of France, and divers men drowned. The English fleet from the Straits, Spain, Portugal, and Biscain, are come safe into the River of Thames, and several Dutch Prizes also. Ten more are expected every Tide. The last Post from France advertiseth, that King Lewis, and his Council have agreed to send an Ambassador Extraordinary unto his Highness the Lord Protector.</p><pb n="3" />

<p>Whereas the great point of <reg orig="Soveraignty">Sovereignty</reg> and concernment to the safety and benefit of a Commonwealth, is the Electing and disposing of its own Magistrates, or the great Officers of State. And as for the <em>present Council</em>, and the election of them in the way it hath <reg orig="bin">been</reg>: It must be <reg orig="remembred">remembered</reg>, that we were in the beginning of a new Government, necessitated to create a little World out of Chaos, and bring Form out of Confusion; so that there was an absolute necessity; that some who are known to be persons of integrity, and firm for the present Settlement, should at the same instant be taken in, to carry on the work: which can be no ground of just exception, especially seeing for the future, Elections shall run in the appointed channel, where their streams are to flow from the People, as their original-Fountain. Yea, the high Office of Protectorship <reg orig="it self">itself</reg> is to be derived also from hence: and as in time it will appear, that the People in Parliament have the main choice of the Council, so they will likewise be <reg orig="Chusers">Choosers</reg> of the Lord Protector: For, it being left to the <reg orig="Counsel">Council</reg> to <reg orig="chuse">choose</reg> Him, and they hereafter coming to be chosen and trusted by the <reg orig="Parlament">Parliament</reg>, it cannot otherwise be conceived, but that the Choice of Him takes its rise mediately from the People in <reg orig="Parlament">Parliament</reg>: because as whatsoever a <reg orig="Parlament">Parliament</reg> doth is said and taken in a political sense to be the <reg orig="peoples">peoples'</reg> act, because they are chosen and trusted by the people: so in like manner, and upon the same political account, when the Council comes to be chosen by <reg orig="Parlaments">Parliaments</reg>, as is before expressed, then the Act of the <reg orig="Councel">Council</reg> in <reg orig="chusing">choosing</reg> the <em>Lord Protector</em>, must be a parity of Reason be reputed the Act of the people in <reg orig="Parlament">Parliament</reg>: And so you see, in effect, mediately or immediately, the election of all Magistrates (both high and low) are, or will at length, by this Constitution of Government, be in the hands of the People.</p>

<p>Lastly, as to what concerns the Office of <em>Lord Protector</em>, it is to be observed, that no man is to be admitted to that dignity upon the Interest of Himself or Family, but <reg orig="meerly">merely</reg> upon the account of his fitness for Government: it must pass, not by Inheritance, but Election. And certainly, it is a great advantage to a Nation that the coming in and continuance of their <reg orig="Governour">Governor</reg> depends only upon his own goodness; and the good will of the<pb n="4" /> People, as it is in an <em>Elective</em> Prince, who standing upon terms of good <reg orig="behavior">behaviour</reg>, will be continually employed for the benefit and defence of the Community. And therefore if it shall please the Lord to bless this Commonwealth (as we trust he will) successively, with a choice of godly persons into that high Office, it is easily foreseen, what an advantage it will be to these 3. Nations, to have their whole strength and force combined thus under one head, for the safety of all: this Form being (without question) the fittest and most convenient for the Magistrate to put things on, and in quick execution (as his proper work) for the <reg orig="publick">public</reg> good: as also what a comfort it will be to all the godly ie the <em>Protestant Churches</em> abroad, who may have some more sure <!--??-->audjcertain protection from <em>England</em> than heretofore; which as it is the greatest Body, being united with <em>Scotland</em>, so it will prove (we hope) the grand Bulwark of the <em><reg orig="Reform'd">Reformed</reg> Religion</em>.</p>

<p>Moreover, as touching the Person, whom the Lord hath now advanced and set over us to be our <reg orig="Supream">Supreme</reg> Magistrate, We shall not say much, because he seeks <reg orig="nat">not</reg> the praise of men: only we believe even the enemies will confess, that he is every way worthy to Rule, whom God hath been pleased to use as his Instrument in that glorious Work of Redeeming the Liberties of his people: For, we are bold to say (weighing all circumstances together) <reg orig="thet">that</reg> this Nation was never really Free - nor in a way of enjoying its Freedom so fully as now: so that there wants nothing but a cordial Close with the Government, to destroy all hopes of the common Enemy, and <reg orig="compleat">complete</reg> our happiness.</p>

<p>But if men shall yet proceed to lengthen their own <reg orig="burthens">burdens</reg>, by hankering after <reg orig="tha">the</reg> Family which God hath cast out before us, or by an unnatural seeking to <reg orig="imbroil">embroil</reg> their Country again in blood and misery, for the sake of that unfortunate Interest, as we are <reg orig="loth">loath</reg> to suspect such a thing, and can hardly imagine that any should be so forlorn and desperate after so fair a Composure.</p><pb n="5" />

<head level="3"><i>A Declaration to the Nation.</i></head>

<p>Having a fair and noble way of Administration provided, under which men may live in a plenary enjoyment of their Liberty as Christians, and their Rights as Men; we do not, neither can we in any measure doubt but that we shall <reg orig="finde">find</reg> a ready and cheerful concurrence from all sober persons; and have ground chiefly to expect it from all the people of God, though of different judgments, seeing equal Liberty is given to them all (without just offence to any) and the principal care is for preventing true Religion, and the countenance of its Professors.</p>

<p>We for our parts have done our duty, in declaring the grounds of our judgment. For, when we look back upon what is done, we find nothing that stares in our faces; and if there could have been imagined any better way of Settlement, we should have <reg orig="imbraced">embraced</reg> it with the same spirit of submission. But here we see, our Friends have taken in the good of all the three sorts of Government, and bound them all in one. If War be, here is the Unitive <reg orig="vertue">virtue</reg> (but nothing else) of Monarchy to encounter it; and here is the admirable Counsel of <reg orig="Aristocracie">Aristocracy</reg> to manage it: If Peace be, here is the industry and courage of <reg orig="Democracie">Democracy</reg> to improve it. And whereas in the present Constitution, the Legislative and Executive Powers are separated: the former being vested<pb n="6" /> in a constant succession of Parliaments elective by the people; the latter in an elective Lord Protector, and his Successors, assisted by a Council; we conceive the State of this <reg orig="Common-wealth">Commonwealth</reg> is thereby reduced to so just a temper, that the Ills either of <reg orig="secessive">successive</reg> Parliaments, furnished with power both of executing and making Laws, or of a perpetual Parliament, (which are Division, Faction, and Confusion) being avoided on the one side, and the inconveniences of absolute Lordly power on the other; the frame of Government appears so well bounded on both sides against Anarchy and Tyranny, that we hope it may now (through the blessing of God) prove a seasonable Mean (as for the better defending of these Dominions against Enemies abroad, and promoting our interest in foreign parts, so also) of peace and settlement to this distracted Nation; and be of a durable continuance to succeeding Ages, for the glory of the most high GOD, the advancement of his Gospel, the protection of his people, and the benefit of Posterity.</p>

<p>Our Occurrences from Holland intimate, that the Prince of Orange and the Royal Party, have declared against the States of the Netherlands,<pb n="7" /> for the Emperor of Germany, has promised them assistance, and is much averse to the present proceedings of the States for a <reg orig="complyance">compliance</reg> with England. The Lord <em>Beverling</em> has signed the Articles, and Ambassadors are appointed to <reg orig="ratifie">ratify</reg> and confirm the whole.</p>

<p>At the Sessions in the Old <reg orig="bayley">Bailey</reg> on Thursday, <reg orig="Fryday">Friday</reg>, and Saturday last was <reg orig="tryed">tried</reg> one <reg orig="Mistris">Mistress</reg> <em>Beard</em>, who upon Evidence, was cast, for bewitching a child: the manner thus: About fifteen Weeks ago, the child was struck lame on the left leg, then in the right Arm, and afterwards struck in a most lamentable and fearful manner, sometimes lying raging and speechless, and at other times foaming at the mouth, with her hand closed up: And having continued thus for many weeks together, at last the said <em>Beard</em> came by, which the child perceiving, <reg orig="immediatly">immediately</reg> fell a raving, by making of <reg orig="signes">signs</reg>, and the like: Whereupon the Parents suspecting her to be the Woman that had <reg orig="bewitcht">bewitched</reg> their child, <reg orig="fetcht">fetched</reg> a Warrant, and had her before a Justice; and after examination, she was committed to Newgate, &amp; from thence, brought down to the Sessions in the Old <reg orig="bayley">Bailey</reg>, where she was arraigned for her life; and upon the Examining of Witnesses, and searching of her, it appeared that she had three long Teats <reg orig="neer">near</reg> to her <reg orig="privie">privy</reg> Parts, which she said was <reg orig="onely">only</reg> the <reg orig="Pyles">Piles</reg>: But upon the giving in of Evidence, she was cast, and divers others, who are like to suffer Death, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Our <em>Occurrences</em> from <em>Holland</em> intimates, that the Difference <reg orig="growes">grows</reg> great between the Royal Party, and the Netherlanders, and that they have already disputed the <reg orig="Quarrell">Quarrel</reg> touching <em>England</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is thought meet that these Occurrences be forthwith printed and published and <reg orig="dispiersed">dispersed</reg> in all Cities, Towns, and Corporations, throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales.</p>
