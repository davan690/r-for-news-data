<head level="3"><em>From</em> Weymouth, January 2.</head>

<p>A<em> <reg orig="Jersy">Jersey</reg></em> Vessel went Saturday last out of this Harbour homewards; but the same night a very great storm rose at Sea, and brought the ship back <reg orig="againe">again</reg> upon our Coast, where she was cast away in the <em>West-bay</em> between <em>Portland</em> and <em>Rotberry</em>, all the men being cast away but the Shipman and two Passengers that were <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg>, going over to <em>Jersey</em> or <em>Guernsey.</em></p>

<head level="3">From <em>Milford</em>-Haven <em>January</em> 2.</head>

<p>There are several Vessels here bound for <em>Ireland</em>, but <reg orig="staied">stayed</reg> here by reason of the contrary winds; we have not heard any news from thence: The Pickeroons are still plying about the Isle of <em>Lundy</em>, and often come into the <em>Severn</em> mouth, where sometimes they catch some of our small Vessels.</p>

<pb n="1" />

<p>There is nothing more from our Fleet, but that part of them are about <em>Plymouth</em>, and other places to the Westward, some lie our towards the Coast of <em>Brittany</em>, to try if they can meet the <em>Brest</em>-men of War, who have now got good ships, and have considerable strength at sea.</p>

<p>This week is arrived our English Fleet from <em>Dunkirk</em>, consisting of about 40 sail, whereof a good part are laden with rich goods, as silk, wrought and unwrought, <unclear>linen</unclear>, <reg orig="thred">thread</reg>, &amp;c. There are come likewise 5 ships from the <em>East-Land</em>, as also one from <em>Zant</em>; but they are not yet brought into the River. This last is laden with Currants.</p>

<head level="3">From <i>Brussels, January</i> 11. Stilo novo</head>

<p>At last we have received a full relation of the Dissolution of your Parliament, which is here variously spoken of according to the <reg orig="humors">humours</reg> and <reg orig="phansie">fancy</reg> of men. But most men in general do look upon it as the fastest and surest way for the establishment of a Government in your Commonwealth. I know not whether you have heard of the death of the Lord Ambassador <em>le Brun</em> at the <em>Hague</em>, who is much lamented here for his good qualities; his <reg orig="vertue">virtue</reg> modesty, and great discretion, had brought him into great request and esteem among most men. It is said that his death did proceed from grief of heart, which he took at the death of his wife, who left him eight children to take care of. The King of Spain his Master, hath lost in his person an able Minister of State, and one who was <reg orig="faithfull">faithful</reg> to his trust reposed in him.</p>

<p>The King of Spain hath lately honoured the Marquis of Trasigny, and the Earl of Sore, with the Golden Fleece, in <reg orig="recompence">recompense</reg> of their services; here are some other Lords that do expect to be gratified after the same manner for their late services.</p>

<p>Some few <reg orig="daies">days</reg> since arrived at Dunkirk six men of War belonging to that place, come from Spain, which have brought over 1500 Spaniards and Irish to serve in these parts: there was a seventh ship in company when they set sail, which must either be put in some Port <pb n="2" />in England, or is cast away with all her men. The Irish men are already <reg orig="marcht">marched</reg> towards Brabant to refresh themselves, and get some <reg orig="cloths">clothes</reg> to their backs, being for most part half naked. This will be another great <reg orig="burthen">burden</reg> to the Country, and little of service, by reason that they are <reg orig="lookt">looked</reg> upon as men more affected to the service of France, <reg orig="then">than</reg> to that of Spain, which they did formerly most affect and desire; but these have suffered themselves to be debauched to serve the King of <em>France</em>.</p>

<p>Since that the Troops of the Prince of Conde and the Duke of Lorain, and others have taken their Winter-quarters by force of arms, in the Country of <unclear>Liege</unclear>, taken some Towns and Castles, and used many other acts of hostility, insolence and violence, It is said that the Prince of Liege and the Archbishop of Cullen, have made a League Offensive and defensive with the two other <reg orig="Ecclesiastick">Ecclesiastic</reg> Electors of Triers and Mentz their confraters to assist all manner of Foreign Forces, under what pretence soever it may be. Here is one lately come from Ireland, who reports of a skirmish that hath happened there, between one Colonel Mortaghe O Brien, at present General of all the <reg orig="Catholicks">Catholics</reg> in arms in Ireland, and 3 Regiments of the Parliaments Forces, wherein he said the said Colonel hath totally <reg orig="destroid">destroyed</reg> those three Regiments, and hath taken from them great store of plunder, and hath made himself Master of Bilbullane, the place where the fight was made. But few do give credit to bare reports, unless something more <reg orig="authentick">authentic</reg> be shown for it.</p>

<p><i>Being constrained for want of room last week, to omit the numbers of the persons that are to be elected to sit in Parliament, from time to time, for the several Counties, Towns and Cities, I shall here insert them, they being according to the proportions hereafter expressed; That is to say,</i></p>

<head level="3">From <reg orig="Gottenburgh">Gothenburg</reg>, November 18.</head>

<p>We began to set sail from Gravesend upon the 6 of this instant November; but the wind coming too much into the North, and being not able to get clear of the sands that day, we were enforced to cast anchor near Quinborough. The next day the wind standing fair, we set sail again, and made a very large course, while about noon the day after; at which time the wind turned full against us, so that we were afraid, that we should have been necessitated to put into Yarmouth Road: But the wind favoured us again for a little time, and we made forward; yet it was not long ere we were much becalmed; and so we were exercised with uncertainties of winds, <reg orig="untill">until</reg> the 12. instant, when there came a very fair wind, which carried us on with full sail; so that on the 14 instant at night, we cast anchor on this side the Seagen, or <unclear>Seah</unclear>. And on the 15. we came betimes into this River. As we came along our ship met with four Holland Fishermen, and boarded one of them: But my Lord Ambassador willing <pb n="8" />to pass peaceably over the Seas, Released it again, which did exceedingly overjoy the poor Skipper, who had been undone in his own thoughts before. Yet the <em>Elizabeth</em>, being one of the <reg orig="Frigats">Frigates</reg> that <reg orig="carryed">carried</reg> some of our company, staying behind to bring up one of our Baggage ships, met with a small Dutch Caper and boarded it and brought it along with them. We were not altogether <unclear>without</unclear> Rough and stormy weather, especially the last night, when we Anchored at the <em>Seagen</em>; insomuch that we were afraid we should have lost one of the Baggage ships, which was but very <unclear>slenderly</unclear> provided with Tackling: yet (through the goodness of God) we are all come safe, and there is none sick among us, nor <reg orig="any thing">anything</reg> lost. <reg orig="Assoon">As soon</reg> as ever we were come into the River, being weary of the Sea, we hasted to shore; so that the Governor and Magistrates of the Town could not be ready to give us that Solemn Reception as they intended. The next day, the three Presidents, and the Magistrates came to salute my Lord in a very handsome Equipage and one of them made a Speech in <reg orig="Latine">Latin</reg>, wherein he acquainted his Lordship; That they had received positive commands from the Queen, to demonstrate all Respects to the English <reg orig="Ambassadour">Ambassador</reg>, whom she had received notice would arrive here in a short time: And <reg orig="withall">withal</reg> desired his <reg orig="Lordships">Lordship's</reg> excuse, that they were not prepared to give him a more pompous entertainment at his first landing. Afterwards the Governor came to give his salutation, which he performed with great demonstration of civility and respect. And, indeed they are very ready to accommodate us in <reg orig="any thing">anything</reg>, and to give us all possible help and assistance in our intended journey towards the Court. The Queen is at present at <em>Upsala</em>, but we are uncertain whether she intends to reside there all this Winter: <reg orig="Tis">'Tis</reg> supposed that she may return again to <em><reg orig="Stockholme">Stockholm</reg></em>, there dying but two of the Sickness the last week. Our journey thither will be tedious and chargeable. And now begin to <reg orig="finde">find</reg> by Experience, That those who are employed upon solemn Missives into so barren a Country, must needs <reg orig="bee">be</reg> <reg orig="supplyed">supplied</reg> with a very large Purse.</p>

<p>After we have Refreshed ourselves, and Rested our Horses here a few <reg orig="dayes">days</reg>, we shall begin our journey, having already sent Letters to the Court of his <em><reg orig="Lordships">Lordship's</reg> <reg orig="arrivall">arrival</reg></em> here. We must be enforced to carry all our Baggage by Land. The <em>Presidents</em> of the city after consultation had amongst themselves, giving us this advice; which will be a vast charge.</p>

<head level="3"><i>News from Portugal</i></head>

<p>The Count of <em>Almarantio</em> Lieut. General of the <em>Spanish</em> Horse, sent forth part of his Troops on the 6 of <em>November</em> to pillage between the Towns of <em>Arontium</em> and <em>Megretum</em>; and to expect there likewise a conjunction of other Forces. But <em>Andreas Albuquercio</em> general of the <em>Portugal</em> Horse, marching towards them, the <em>Spaniards</em> seemed by a false march to be retreating, that they might unite with their main body, and so fall upon the <em>Portugal</em> Forces: which the <em>Portugal</em> perceiving, the <reg orig="Governour">Governor</reg> of <em>Castelvitense,</em> a <em>Portugal</em> <reg orig="Governour">Governor</reg>, speeded away with about 250 Horse towards the <reg orig="enemies">enemy's</reg> frontiers, not far from <em>Valenita</em>; where coming in view of 300 <em>Spanish</em> horse, he after a short dispute, put them to flight, and pursued them so far, that at length he came in view of 400 other horse of the <reg orig="enemies">enemy's</reg>; by whom being over-numbered, and his men being disordered in the pursuit, he was repelled with the loss of some few, many wounded, and the <reg orig="Governour">Governor</reg> himself with two Engines, were taken. On the <em>Spanish</em> side, was one Captain slain, in this skirmish, and divers mortally wounded; among whom, <em>Don Alvarez a Luna</em>, so to the Count of <em>Montigiense</em>.</p>

<p>Hereupon, <em>Albuquercio</em> general of the <em>Portugal</em> horse, followed the enemy betimes the next morning, and found them not far from <em>Aroncium</em> very numerous, driving away 1200 head of cattle. The Spaniards were 1500. the Portugals but 950 horse. It was valiantly fought by both sides, and notwithstanding the odds in number, the Portugals became victors, and had pursuit of the enemy till night. There fell many gallant Commanders of the Spanish party; among whom, <em>Almarantius</em> their Major general, 17 Colonels, and many wounded. The number of Spanish slain upon the place, and of them that fell in the fight was 300. 400 taken prisoners, and a great number of horses, by the Portugals; who also had some loss, but not considerable. No Officers slain, save <reg orig="onely">only</reg> a Major, divers are wounded.</p>

<p>There is not much hath come to my knowledge since the last.

<p>Most worthy, loving Friend,</p>

<p>I cannot omit or pass by (having saluted you) but relate the great sadness that is here, to wit, the hand of God manifesting <reg orig="it self">itself</reg> by a very great and lamentable fire breaking forth in the night, between the <reg orig="sixt">sixth</reg> and seventh of <em>January</em>; as thus, about half an hour past eleven of the clock that night; it began at the South-end, in a Mill that beats hemp, called by the name of the <em>Reyger</em>, which could not be quenched in <reg orig="any-wise">any wise</reg> by reason of the <reg orig="vehemency">vehemence</reg> of the wind. So that the fire overrunning that in the first place, with over-<reg orig="violency">violence</reg> consumed all to the very ground, <reg orig="aswell">as well</reg> in the South end, and all in St. Jacobs street, and the Meal-sacks neighbourhood, as also the Anabaptists Congregation-house, and a Church of ours, with the Church-house, and Town-house, leaving in the room much desolation. The number of houses destroyed, as men compute, are between five and six hundred, besides many <pb n="14" />Busses, Boats, and fishing Vessels, whose number is not yet known. Thus the fire continued (being driven with the wind) as far as the Bemster-dike, the <reg orig="bridg">bridge</reg> in the way being also fired. Some men give out that the fire flew over into the Bemster, to the damage of many there. Moreover it is affirmed that divers people, great and small, have been overtaken by the fire, and burnt; but whether so or not, time will produce it to us. The sadness is here greater that I can intimate or transcribe. God in his mercy preserve all people from such sad disasters, and <reg orig="dolefull">doleful</reg> violations. Farewell, and rest commended in the Lord, more particularly with the next.</p>

<p>The 28 of December, the enemy had a Rendezvous upon the Hangh (a piece of plain ground near Weyme.) The parts about Weyme are miserably wasted, and the Gentlemen of Atholl ill resenting their oppression, Kenmore and Glengary <reg orig="marcht">marched</reg> North with about 200 horse and foot, intending to meet Seafort at Lagennongham Drum, where their whole body intends to <reg orig="Rendezvouz">Rendezvous</reg>: Before their going there was a falling out between Kenmore and Glengary, and a Duel appointed, but prevented by the endeavours and wits of their associates. Wogan with his 20 Cavaliers, are at present with Atholl near Logiret, well mounted, armed, and several of them in rich apparel, which <reg orig="ads">adds</reg> <reg orig="incouragement">encouragement</reg> to the Highland fury. The enemy have had severally spoiled most of such horses as they have taken from <reg orig="Gentlements">Gentlemen's</reg> stables, their bellies almost <reg orig="dryed">dried</reg> up with heats, too much corn and ill dressing. Their Levies in Perthshire are at a stand; they get no men but some poor rogues; and the <unclear>penalty</unclear> they impose upon the Country is, if they can take a rich man, they keep him till he can ransom himself; and take several able bodied men out of their beds, and force them into arms, or make them hire others; but what addition they will have in the North, is uncertain.</p>

<p>On Friday last, the Earl of Kenole, about 8 in the morning, appeared near <reg orig="Glams">Glamis</reg>, with a party of horse, consisting <pb n="15" />of 70 or thereabouts; his <reg orig="designe">design</reg> was to <reg orig="sursprize">surprise</reg> the horse belonging to <reg orig="Glams">Glamis</reg>, as they came from watering, lying in a covert-place for that purpose, thinking thereby to increase his number, and to procure exchange for his men taken at Edgill, and coming at first with a small party riding into <reg orig="Glams">Glamis</reg>, took 3 of our men, which Major Ducket (who commanded Col. <reg orig="Riches">Riche's</reg> Troop then) having notice, sent out his Quartermaster with 20 horse, to discover his party, who advancing with two files of foot that were to make good a <reg orig="bridg">bridge</reg>, gave them a charge, and routed and dispersed their whole party, took the Lord Kinole and 14 more, all much wounded: about <unclear>35</unclear> horse: and at the coming away of the Letter, had sent out a party to gather up the rest, all quitting their horses, and betaking to the bogs; Major Ramsay was there, but escaped. We had one man killed, and 7 wounded all slightly; three of the enemy were killed on the place, and our men that were taken, rescued.</p>
