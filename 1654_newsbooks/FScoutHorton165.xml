<p>The K of Scots is now going for Germany: from whence our Scout bringeth intelligence, that the Emperor is coming down by land against the Hollander, requiring restitution for several injuries by them committed. Maj. Gen. <em>Middleton</em> is gone for the North of Scotland with about two hundred Cavaliers, he was transported by 7 ships from Holland, and <reg orig="caryed">carried</reg> some Arms and Ammunition. Ha, ha! I smell a Rat: pick Dutch <unclear>spregne</unclear> out of that.</p><pb n="1" />

<p>The next thing that presents <reg orig="it self">itself</reg> to <reg orig="publike">public</reg> view, is, the strange Vision of Mr. John Farley; a true copy whereof followeth:</p>

<p>I saw in a Vision revealed unto me as I was standing upon stone steps, at a place in London, there came a man riding before me, and made a stand against me, and then I saw a Coach coming between the man and me passing by, and in the Coach was a woman <reg orig="cloathed">clothed</reg> in scarlet, and one who stood by me, said: Behold this Woman! how do you like of her? And I answered I liked none but mine own; and then the man who was on the horse back said unto me, then it seemeth you like none, but your own, 'tis well: then there came 6 youths in <reg orig="blew">blue</reg> caps, &amp; stood between the man on horseback and me, and said, Behold! take notice of the Moon, and thereupon I looked up and saw a <reg orig="sign-post">signpost</reg>, with the sign of the Moon hanging as a sign under it, which I beholding, presently there appeared a spot of blood upon the picture of the Moon which spot spread <reg orig="it self">itself</reg> over all the Moon, and the blood sparkled up upon the <reg orig="skey">sky</reg> and overspread the same. Then suddenly falling down upon my knees, and lifting up my hands to heaven, I called upon the Lord to be my Protector, and <reg orig="immediatly">immediately</reg> upon that there appeared by the picture of the Moon and a man sitting, having a candle light in his hand; then came another man with a candle unlighted in his hand, which he lighted at the other candle. And then the man who sat by the Moon spake and said, I thank you all for beholding the same. The there came a Chariot with milk white horses, like as if it had come out of a Court by the place where I stood; and as they approached near me, I thought them to be of fire, so sparkling that the heat thereof came mightily unto me, whereby I was forced to shrink back from the extremity thereof, and returning two or three steps back, I beheld the Chariot and horse coming up the steps after me: thus going back, and seeking for some place for shelter to keep <reg orig="my self">myself</reg> from the heat thereof; but finding neither doors nor shop <reg orig="windowes">windows</reg> open, I could have no place of <reg orig="safefuard">safeguard</reg>. And seeing before me another Chariot with horses approaching toward me, I was greatly troubled in mind; and then beholding upon my right hand a street turning another way, in which I thought to be free, <reg orig="entred">entered</reg> the same: And having gone but a little<pb n="2" /> way therein, it was beset in like manner. And there came foremost a man having a long light like unto a Torch in his hand, which when I saw it, I thought it was <reg orig="Dooms-day">Doomsday</reg>, and fell to the ground as a dead man, and could not move hand nor foot, yet had my remembrance perfect; and when he came unto me, he said, Who is here? But I said nothing unto him, and then he strode on foot over me, and lift me up from the earth, and held me in his arms, and <reg orig="blue">blew</reg> into mine ears three or four times: and then said he there was no means to help me, but to be washed with the blood of <reg orig="Iesus">Jesus</reg> Christ: so soon as he had spoken, I perceived <reg orig="my self">myself</reg> to be naked, and then he washed and bathed my body all in blood; which being done, he departed and went forward, and I thought he drew me after him. Then presently I was brought like as if I had been in some great Church, wherein was much Timberwork, and there I saw men washing and besmearing all the posts and timber with blood, and then I seemed to depart out of the same place; but coming to the door of it, I heard as it were the rushing of a mighty wind, with a noise of chariots and horses, with beholding of sumptuous buildings and multitudes of men; and being astonished therewith, I returned into the Church again; and then by that time I seemed to have a great bundle of bladders about me, which vanished all but three, whereof one was very little, and the rest were very great, especially one of them, and these two seemed like two earthen pots, which wearied me to bear. And as I went forward in a back way flying from the Church, I heard a <reg orig="voyce">voice</reg>, saying, Go apace: and when I came to the end, at a place where I could go no further, I thought these pots did diminish mightily; and there came a <reg orig="voyce">voice</reg> unto me, saying, there will not be left the worth of a <reg orig="half peny">halfpenny</reg> remaining of all this sight; so I awaked, But being in fear and amazement at this Bloody Vision, within a quarter of an hour after fell into a Trance again, and saw another Vision, which is as followeth: I beheld, and lo, I was in a field as I thought, newly sown with Wheat, and as I beheld, I saw upon the Land sowed a company of Doves, being milk white, and all of them stood in a round Ring, or Circle, and in the midst was <reg orig="onely">only</reg> one alone by himself, which surpassed all the rest in brightness, shining like the <reg orig="Sun-beams">Sunbeams</reg> in its brightness, so did this Dove appear in brightness and glory, and I awaked again, These were the Visions<pb n="3" /> which Mr. <reg orig="Farly">Farley</reg> related unto me; I shall now give you the interpretation thereof, as I gave it to him then.</p>

<head level="3">Wednesday Feb. 15.</head>

<p>His <reg orig="Highnese">Highness</reg> the Lord Protector has appointed certain <reg orig="dayes">days</reg> every week to receive Reports from the Masters of Requests of Petitions presented to them, and to give Answers.</p>

<p>The Highlanders grow numerous in Scotland; and the Tories are too potent in Ireland. They have had several <reg orig="Rendezvouzes">Rendezvouses</reg>; and sundry times made incursions upon the Lowlanders. But care is taken to prevent the like for the future, if we can. The King of Scots has sent Letters to them, promising aid and assistance. But alas! fair words butter no Parsnips!</p>

<p>The English fleet rides still about St. <reg orig="Hellens">Helen's</reg> Point; but the Dutch are not yet forth. There has been a great <reg orig="shipwrack">shipwreck</reg> upon the Coast of France, and divers men drowned. The English fleet from the Straits, Spain, Portugal, and <reg orig="Biscain">Biscayne</reg>, are come safe into the River of Thames, and several Dutch Prizes also. Ten more are expected every Tide. The last Post from France advertiseth, that King Lewis and his Council have agreed to send an Ambassador Extraordinary unto his Highness the Lord Protector.</p>

<p>From Holland it is further certified, that the United Provinces have brought in their Ratification to the Articles for Peace, and that they have both signed and sealed <reg orig="ingeneral">in general</reg>; and are preparing of an Ambassador to be sent unto his Highness the Lord Protector for the confirming thereof: It is said the Lord Updam is the man elected: But of this, more in my next.</p>

<head level="3"><i>The interpretation of the first Vision.</i></head>

<p>Whereas you saw <reg orig="your self">yourself</reg> standing upon stone steps in London, it signifies the firmness thereof. And whereas you saw a Coach with a Woman in it all clothed in scarlet passing by, signifies a bloody enemy that will suddenly vanish away and be consumed. And whereas you saw six youths all in blue, they <reg orig="signifie">signify</reg> Charles his Wain, and their <reg orig="Voyce">Voice</reg> which said; Behold, take notice of the Moon, signifies the Comet or Blazing Star, which Star signified the dissolution of the late power. And whereas you saw a sign post with the sign of the Moon to it, and of the spot of blood that appeared upon it, and <reg orig="ovepread">overspread</reg> both it and the sky; by the sign of the Moon as signified the multiplicity of Divisions. And whereas you saw a man sitting by the<pb n="6" /> picture of the Moon with the light like a candle in his hand, and another man coming to him with a candle unlighted, signifies the issuing forth Commissions by an eminent Commander for aid and assistance. And whereas you saw a Chariot with milk white horses coming out of a Court, and the Chariot of fire, signifies a violent interest to be set up, so that all will in that day be forced to shut up their shop windows and doors for fear, so that he which is without <reg orig="doores">doors</reg> <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> not <reg orig="finde">find</reg> a place wherein to hide his head, but the violating of Tyranny restores us to our former pristine liberty.</p>

<head level="3"><i>The interpretation of the second Vision.</i></head>

<p>Then said I, whereas you saw <reg orig="your self">yourself</reg> in a field newly sown with Wheat; that signifies a new Government to be established in <reg orig="Brittain">Britain</reg>, that is, the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, more glorious <reg orig="then">than</reg> ever was upon earth. And whereas you say a company of milk white Doves upon that field, all in a round ring or circle: The Ring or Circle, signifies the endless, everlasting, and everstanding Court that <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> be established. And the company of milk white Doves signifies the <reg orig="spot less">spotless</reg> Saints that have continued faithful to his Highness. Therefore they and their <unclear>seed</unclear> <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> <reg orig="tryumph">triumph</reg> gloriously for ever. And whereas you saw one Dove alone in the middle of the Ring, or Circle, which did shine like the Sun in brightness; by that Dove is signified his Highness, who in due time will shine like the Sun over all the earth, to answer the expectation of all Nations, and <reg orig="fulfill">fulfil</reg> the promise of our Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>From France our Scout bringeth us intelligence that the Duke of York is recovered of his sickness; and that his brother Charles is very active; but alas! poor Gentleman, to little purpose: the stream runs current, who dares interpose? for my part I dare not, neither <reg orig="wil">will</reg> I: therefore,</p>

<head level="2">God speed the Plough,</head>

<p>And the Lord protect Us: A glorious, peaceable, and happy Government, who questions, but that we shall enjoy under his Highness: For, observe the Dream of Mr. <reg orig="Ienkins">Jenkins</reg> in Windsor Castle, on Tuesday night last, to wit, That God will stain the pride of all glory, and<pb n="7" /> the glory of all flesh, tumbling the earth upside down, and tossing to and fro the Government thereof, that nothing but confusion hath appeared; what certainly then can be expected in such changes? what order in <reg orig="confusign">confusion</reg> ? Yea what Truth, when God is making man a <reg orig="lye">lie</reg> ? <em>Isa</em>. 40. 6, 7, 13, to 17. what Oaths of Allegiance? What Covenants broken? Yet in both, hands have been lifted up to Heaven by honest hearts: what Protestations, <reg orig="Remonstrances">Remonstrance</reg>, and Engagements are gone and vanished? First we were all for the King, <reg orig="then">than</reg> for none; yet for King and Parliament we fought, then for neither: once we professed for the House of Lords, but these were presently laid aside: then for the Commons <reg orig="onely">only</reg>, and yet not for that, but for a Parliament or Representative; this <reg orig="dis-appears">disappears</reg> also. And seeing the Princes of Israel begin to appear, and the people of God are in present power (as 'twas never before) I hope they will hear what has been said by their brethren, though carried forth with much zeal, which (being according to their knowledge, and that knowledge the <em>light of God</em> in them, and they led forth with that <em><reg orig="boldnesse">boldness</reg></em>, and that forbearance appearing in the <em>Powers</em> also, and such peace and love still abiding in both) tells me, that these Wars and <reg orig="Wranglingt">Wrangling</reg> will shortly cease in the Nation, in which God will so appear with power and glory, that all the Nations about shall be broken, or brought in with us at last to the Government of <reg orig="Iesus">Jesus</reg>.</p>

<p>This day I am informed of a Truth, that now in Monmouthshire, near <em>Ragland</em>, in an Orchard, and Apple-tree hath had green Leaves, <reg orig="Budds">Buds</reg>, and young Apples. These are strange variations of the Seasons.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night last, one Mr. <em>Durton</em> of Grays-Inn, and about 15 other young Gentlemen, [some whereof were London Prentices, but of good repute) met at the Ship-Tavern in the Old <reg orig="Bayley">Bailey</reg>, at Mr <em>Amps</em>, where they called for a Room and the Drawer conducted them two pair of stairs high: and bringing in a quart of Sack, they began a health, and, as 'tis said, fell into consultation upon a design against his Highness the Lord Protector: but timely notice being given, their Plot was frustrated, and themselves <reg orig="appprehended">apprehended</reg> by his <reg orig="Highnesses">Highness's</reg> <reg orig="Life-guard">Lifeguard</reg>, who came into the said Tavern with their pistols <reg orig="cockt">cocked</reg>, went directly <reg orig="up stairs">upstairs</reg> where they were, and secured them all.</p>
