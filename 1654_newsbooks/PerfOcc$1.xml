<p>It is certified that one of our <reg orig="Frigots">Frigates</reg> who Convoyed some <reg orig="Amunition">Ammunition</reg>, and divers Merchant ships to <em>Leith</em>, <reg orig="war">was</reg> set upon by the <reg orig="dutch">Dutch</reg>, and after a furious Fight boarded, and carried away.</p>

<p>There is a Report also, that they took some other ships that were with her.</p>

<p>It is certified also that the constant Warwick had no sooner put off from <em><reg orig="Plimouth">Plymouth</reg></em> where she was new tallowed, but she met with a <em>Picaroon</em> belonging to brest, and <reg orig="immediatly">immediately</reg> <reg orig="surprized">surprised</reg>, she carried but four guns but was an excellent <reg orig="saylor">sailor</reg>.</p>

<p>By Letters by the Post from <em>Scotland</em>, it was this Day advertised, that Major Gen: <em>Dyal</em>, who lately came over with Gen: <em>Middleton</em>, hath besieged <em>Senclair</em> Castle, with a party of 400 Foot, and 800 horse, but the place being made strong both by <unclear>Air</unclear>, and Nature, and well victualled, they do not much fear the assaults of, their <reg orig="Enimies">Enemies</reg>,</p>

<p>The Armies on both sides are preparing to receive each other, and Col. <em>Morgan</em> has drained <reg orig="Innerness">Inverness</reg> to <reg orig="joyn">join</reg> with those forces which he brought from Aberdeen, so that he lies with about 1200 Horse and Dragoons, and 2000 Foot, betwixt the Enemy and the passes they must needs through, if they intend to move out of the North corner; so they <reg orig="wil">will</reg> be compelled to fight, and 'tis said, they are resolved, there being no way left them to avoid it, but through such <reg orig="inaccesable">inaccessible</reg> bounds as <reg orig="tis">'tis</reg> impossible for their horse to march that way, and very difficult for their Foot,</p>

<p><em>From Dalkeith</em>, April 19. thus.

Col. <em>Daniel</em>, Capt. <em>Elsmare</em>, and others have lately met with divers of the Rebels, so that <reg orig="tha">the</reg> prisoners begin now so to fill that the only way to ease the Commonwealth of their charge will be to send these Idle people to <reg orig="Barbadoes">Barbados</reg> to work for their living, which <reg orig="wil">will</reg> be done very suddenly.</p><pb n="3" />

<p>This day his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg> the Lord Protector taking in consideration, how much it might conduce to the glory of God, and the Peace and welfare of the people of this whole Island, that after all those late and unhappy wars and differences, the people of Scotland should be united with the people of England, into one <reg orig="Common-wealth">Commonwealth</reg>: For perfecting of which union, it is ordained by his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg> the Lord Protector, by and with the advice of his <reg orig="Councel">Council</reg>, That all the people of <reg orig="Scotlannd">Scotland</reg>, and of the Isles of Orkney and <reg orig="shethland">Shetland</reg>, and of all the Dominions and Territories belonging unto Scotland, are and shall be, and are hereby incorporated into, constituted, established, declared and confirmed one <reg orig="Common-wealth">Commonwealth</reg> with England, and in every Parliament to be held successively, thirty persons <reg orig="shell">shall</reg> be called from, and serve for Scotland.</p><pb n="6" />

<p>The Queen of Sweden seems to hold her resolution to resign up her Crown, and the Treaty goeth on fairly touching the affairs with England.</p>

<p>By <reg orig="Setters">Letters</reg> out of <reg orig="Flandes">Flanders</reg> it is <reg orig="certefied">certified</reg>, that the Duke of <reg orig="Lorrain">Lorain</reg> is still kept in Custody by the <reg orig="Arch Duke">Archduke</reg>. The Army which was under his Command, are yet in their quarters, Duke Francis of <reg orig="Lorrain">Lorain</reg> the second Brother, is expected there, to take upon him the command of that Army which his Brother had, and then no doubt he will be courted very high both by the Spaniard and the French.</p>

<p>From France thus. The <reg orig="Marqesse">Marques</reg> de St. Centez, field Marshal in <reg orig="Majesties">Majesty's</reg> Armies is come to <reg orig="Phillipsburgh">Phillipsburg</reg> where he is to be Governor, the former Commander having resigned him the place according to<pb n="7" /> his <reg orig="Majesties">Majesty's</reg> Orders thereupon.

There was a quarrel between Sir <em>George Monroe</em> and E. of <em>Glencarn</em>, for <reg orig="plundring">plundering</reg> of, and abusing the Laird of <em>Fowlis</em> (<em><reg orig="Monroes">Monroe's</reg></em> brother) who was extremely abused by them, which rose so high, that they appointed to Fight a combat, and accordingly on the last <reg orig="Lords">Lord's</reg> day in the morning they mounted and rid to the place appointed, and because <em><reg orig="Monro">Monroe</reg></em> would fight on Horseback, he took his pistols with him, but <em>Glencairn</em> bid him put away his pistols and they would fight only on Horseback with their swords in which Combat <em><reg orig="Monro">Monroe</reg></em> had his right hand almost cut off and a cut in the forehead: <em>Glencairn</em> was likewise cut in the head. There was also a quarrel between <em>Athol</em> and <em>Glengary</em> about precedency of place, and afield appointed, but the business was taken up by the commanders.</p>
