<p>Some have imputed the aspersion of Lying, as well as Theft, to most <em>Mercuries</em>, especially to those of the Court: Lying is abominated by <em>Aulicus</em>; but if he <reg orig="steales">steals</reg> your Attentions, the Theft, he hopes is not unpardonable: He desires to appear <reg orig="unbyassed">unbiased</reg>, and to give you a plain and perfect information of <em>Occurrences</em>, with the only quintessence that hitherto the <reg orig="Alchymie">Alchemy</reg> of his Wit could draw out, promising, that passion and interest shall not interpose, and let him thrive, as his intents are honest! Yet in these Times (wherein the Tongue and Press assume so luxurious a Latitude) He will not presume to interfere with Reason of State, nor the necessity Art of Government: To doubt of <unclear>his</unclear> Highness my Lord <reg orig="Protectors">Protector's</reg> doing Justice, is an effeminacy of belief.</p>

<p>This day his Highness (according to his propensity to relieve the Oppressed) could not give Audience (being impeded by other occasions of State) unto the Masters of Requests, concerning Petitions; <pb n="1" /> which occasioned storms of sighs from the passive Breast of expecting <em>Aulicus</em>, whose patience shall willingly submit to the more serious Affairs of State.</p>

<p>This day Major <em>Bourn</em> and others were robbed at Shooters Hill, <em>an injury not to be born with</em>: many that had been before robbed were bound, and laid by in a Wood <reg orig="neer">near</reg> <reg orig="adjoyning">adjourning</reg>: the same Thieves assaulted a Coach coming from <em>Canterbury</em>, wherein was one Gentleman, and two Ladies, with a Gentleman on horseback appertaining to the Coach, who with <reg orig="undanted">undaunted</reg> valour charging them, which were 5 in number, was in the Conflict slain, though assisted by him in the Coach, who received a shot, and fought with such gallantry, that he wounded one of the Thieves: Notwithstanding whose valour, the Coach at last was robbed of 30 <em>l.</em> but the Thieves, through haste and fear, did <reg orig="over-see">oversee</reg> 50 <em>l.</em> which was in a <reg orig="Portmantle">Portmanteau</reg>. The <reg orig="Countrey">Country</reg> was raised, and Col. <em>Blount</em> made <reg orig="Hu-and Cry">Hue and Cry</reg> after them, but to no effect. The Gentleman slain in the Combat was buried at <em>Greenwich</em>, and, as it is credibly reported, the Thief that was wounded coming to Mr. <unclear><em>Moloints</em></unclear>, a <unclear><reg orig="Chyrnrgeon">Surgeon</reg></unclear> in<reg orig="Shooe-lane">Shoe lane</reg>, to be <reg orig="drest">dressed</reg>; and having <unclear>laid</unclear> down his Cloak, being desired to stay till a Gentleman wounded at Shooters hill was <reg orig="drest">dressed</reg>, <reg orig="loth">loath</reg> to tempt his Destiny, made use of his heels, but not his Cloak; and being pursued with full cry, was (as 'tis <reg orig="rumour'd">rumoured</reg> taken in Cheapside, and is like to make his Will at Tyburn.</p>
<p>The treaty between the Dutch Ambassadors, and our Commissioners, had some furtherance this day.</p>
<p>From onboard the <em>Taunton</em> <reg orig="Frigat">Frigate</reg> the 17 of <em>March</em> then at <em>Portsmouth</em>; and by a Letter of a later date, thus: This day we came from Sea; but know not how soon we shall out again to meet with the <reg orig="Armado">Armada</reg> of <em>Holland</em>: their number, as we have received intelligence, consists of one hundred and forty men of War.</p>
<p>From <reg orig="Upsal">Uppsala</reg> in Sweden Jan. 20. thus: The treaty goes on between the Lord Ambassador <em>Whitlock</em>, and her Majesty, by her grand Chancellor, who treats <reg orig="onely">only</reg> in the <reg orig="Latine">Latin</reg> Tongue. <i>Then who but blind men <pb n="2" /> would put out <em>England's</em> Eyes, the <em>Universities?</em> like the Fox in the Fable, <reg orig="contemning">condemning</reg> the Grapes they cannot reach.</i></p>

<p>It was a saying of <em>Scipio</em>, that excellent Commanders, Statesmen, and Philosophers, that he loved not a City, <i>stantibus m&oelig;nibus, <unclear>ruentibus moribus</unclear></i>.

<p>The two Ordinances touching Ministers, and touching the law, is before a Committee, whereof Justice Hales in the Chair.</p>
<p>This day the Commissioners from the Lord Protector went from his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg> in two Coaches with the Secretary of State, and the Clerk of the Council, and their attendants to the Dutch Ambassadors, at Sir Abraham <reg orig="Williams">William's</reg>; from whence they are not yet removed to Sir John <reg orig="Trevers">Trever's</reg>: they were met at the gate by the Lords Ambassadors, where the Lord Beverling made a speech to them, and they received them with great respect and love on both sides. Being come into the House and into a chamber appointed for their Conference; they spent much time in order to the <unclear>finishing</unclear> of the peace. The business this day, was, to confer their Papers of the agreement, for though they have agreed, yet it is <reg orig="ingrossed">engrossed</reg> by each side, and on Wednesday last they compared their papers; which when both compared together, do in all particulars agree; then they are to sign on both sides. And what they sign, the Dutch Ambassadors do in the name of the States General. But to confirm it the more, it is to be sent to the States, who are also to give their assent after the Ratification, and then they deliver the Articles on both sides, which <reg orig="its">it's</reg> conceived will be done within the space of three weeks.</p>

<p>By a Letter from <em>Lyn</em> in <em>Norfolk</em>, that came this day it was thus certified, That Mr. <em>Robert Autforth</em> of the same town had lost his ship being taken by a man of War upon the Coast of S<em>cotland</em>. Twelve more were forced ashore by the <em><reg orig="Belgick">Belgic</reg> Bores</em>.</p>
<p>The Council at <reg orig="White-hall">Whitehall</reg> have taken into consideration the abuse of farthings, and have debated the allowance of tokens to be made by one that will make them of intrinsical value. The Queen of Sweden is sending a message to the Lord Protector <reg orig="Cromwel">Cromwell</reg>, by way of congratulation and <reg orig="withall">withal</reg> has set down her Resolution for War against the Emperor, having in readiness 39000 horse and foot.</p>
<p>By letters this day received from <em>Ireland</em> it is certified that the Lord <em>Hon. <reg orig="Cromwel">Cromwell</reg></em> (by the permission of the Almighty) will return hither in a fortnight, nothing of disturbance being there: Adjutant Gen. <em>Allen</em>, and one <em>Standich</em> come over with him.</p>
<p>The Lord Protector is now upon removing to the gallant and magnificent Palace of <reg orig="White-hall">Whitehall</reg> there to keep his Court.</p>

<p>Vanity at this day opens all her <reg orig="doores">doors</reg> to manifest divers persons to the World, who would have otherwise been <reg orig="buryed">buried</reg> in obscurity: <pb n="4" /> such a person some judged one <em>I</em> met with at Court this week, who has long waited to obtain an Order, that there may be a Hearing of each <reg orig="mans">man's</reg> Cause within 40 <reg orig="dayes">days</reg> after the Petition is exhibited: for, saith he, <i>where there is no Law, there is no transgression</i>; And this would mind Committees and persons <reg orig="intrusted">entrusted</reg> with business of this Nature to be very <reg orig="cautelous">cautious</reg> how they eat up the Poor by tedious <reg orig="delayes">delays</reg>, when a Petitioner many times dines <reg orig="onely">only</reg> upon <em>Air</em>, though perhaps an <em>Heir</em> to a considerable estate. I demanded what benefit this Gentleman would have by obtaining this, he said it would be a general good, and that was sufficient recompense. I <reg orig="ask'd">asked</reg> him what he was? He <reg orig="replyed">replied</reg>, <i>A Master of Arts</i>. I retorted, that if he could effect this, he would be a Master of his Art indeed: His name is Mr. <em>Thomas Philpot</em>, but his countenance promises him to be no such <unclear>Patriot</unclear>, nor Politician: but if there be such a man living, that <reg orig="layes">lays</reg> himself out <reg orig="onely">only</reg> for the <reg orig="publique">public</reg> good, I think it is rare <reg orig="newes">news</reg> indeed. Honest <em>Tom!</em> thy Design, if it arrives to perfection, (for we use to judge by events) will render thee as famous, as was <em>Drake, Forbisher, Raleigh</em>, or any, whose nobler Spirits <reg orig="pusht">pushed</reg> them forward to brave <unclear><reg orig="Designes">Designs</reg></unclear>.</p>

<p>This Certificate I have here inserted at the desire of Mr. <em>Edmund <unclear>Felton</unclear></em>, an ancient, experienced, and approved Engineer.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Edmund Felton</em> Gent. hath of late discovered unto the Committee of Fortification of the City of <em>London</em>, how an Engine of his Invention will secure the foot from the horse, and the <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg> from musket shot, one Engine to supply the room of 24 Pike men, or more, which said Engine two men may manage at pleasure: for the seeing of which, we appointed some of the said Committee to see and try the said Engine, which hath hanging <reg orig="Brest-work">Breastwork</reg>, and was shot at about 40 paces distant, the <reg orig="musquetiers">musketeers</reg> <reg orig="raming">ramming</reg> in powder and bullet, yet could not the shot pierce <reg orig="thorow">through</reg> the said <reg orig="Breast-work">Breastwork</reg>, which we who were appointed did see, and so reported to the rest of the Committee; And being requested by the said <em>Ed.

<p>The Highlanders increase in Scotland, and Gen. Middleton begins to play <em>Rex</em> again: they had a <reg orig="Rendevouz">Rendezvous</reg> upon the 11 instant, and are now marching towards the Lord <unclear><reg orig="Reaffs">Reaff's</reg></unclear> Bounds. There hath lately happened a great disaster between Cap. <reg orig="Palmers">Palmer's</reg> troop and Cap. <reg orig="Masons">Mason's</reg>, the manner thus: Cap. Palmer having pursued the enemy, at least met with a party of horse, which he took to be the enemy, <reg orig="wherupon">whereupon</reg> he charged them desperately but were as gallantly repulsed by Cap. Mason, who charged them through and through, and for the space of half an hour the business was very disputable, in which unhappy engagement 6 were slain on both sides and 8 wounded, whereof Cap. Palmer is one.</p>
<p>From Plymouth <reg orig="wee">we</reg> have certain intelligence, that the <reg orig="Saphire">Sapphire</reg> <reg orig="frigat">frigate</reg> hath taken three <unclear>delicate</unclear> Vessels laden with Wine, Beans, and Salt. Nine more taken on the Coast of Scotland, and Cap. Wilkins hath taken another, bravely fraught with rich Merchandizes. The Royal <reg orig="Soveraign">Sovereign</reg> is now put forth to sea, and rides in Stoke bay. Two Merchants ships that were coming from Ipswich toward London, were taken by a Dutch man of war, they <reg orig="clapt">clapped</reg> the English of both under the Decks of one of them, on the 4 of March, and then left them, sending them homeward; but the next day the English at a seasonable time lifted up the decks, relieved themselves, took the Dutch, and <reg orig="clapt">clapped</reg> them under the deck where they were, and brought away both their ships to the Downs, which are now safe in the River, with the prisoners.</p>
<p>The Queen of <em>Bohemia</em> (sister to the late King of Great <reg orig="Brittain">Britain</reg>) is going to <em><reg orig="Frankendale">Frankendael</reg></em>, which is her Dowry, a most wealthy place, and of great frequentation, it being the <reg orig="mid-way">midway</reg> betwixt <em><reg orig="Wormes">Worms</reg></em> and <em>Spiers</em> where she will do the best she can to entertain young <em>Charles</em>, and to accommodate him in the present juncture of <reg orig="Affaires">Affairs</reg>. His brother JAMES (second Son to his late Majesty) is as valiant as Hector <pb n="6" /> in the King of France's Army; but the little Queen (his Mother) is of a sudden struck very <reg orig="solentary">solitary</reg>. The Lord <em>Wilmot</em>, and the Lord <em>Wentworth</em> do with much importunity press upon the loyal breasts of the English in several places to support the weak distressed Estate of their Prince; especially at the city of <reg orig="Hamborough">Hamburg</reg>, where the Lord <em>Wentworth</em> did <reg orig="extreamly">extremely</reg> <reg orig="solicite">solicit</reg> and importune the Treasurer of the English company, who fearing his power, and loath to part with those monies which belonged to all the English Merchants who <reg orig="traffick">traffic</reg> in those parts, acquainted the President of the English Companies with it, and <reg orig="withall">withal</reg>, <reg orig="shewed"> showed</reg>the inconveniences that would arise, if he <reg orig="shold">should</reg> deliver such <reg orig="moneyes">monies</reg> to him. Whereupon the President weighing the truth of the Reasons, <unclear>made</unclear> his complaint to the Senate, who <reg orig="enjoyned">enjoined</reg> the Lord <em>Wentworth</em> not to exact any sums of money of the Treasurer, unless he was able to put in good security for the re-disbursing of them.</p>
<p>From <em>Plymouth</em> we have received intelligence, that the Constant Warwick, and the Portsmouth <reg orig="frigat">frigate</reg> being together, met with the great <reg orig="Pyrate">Pirate</reg> Cap. <em>Beach</em>, who had newly taken two prizes; but perceiving that our <reg orig="frigats">frigates</reg> intended to pursue him, he left the Prizes, and was afterward secured by the night coming on. The same night the Portsmouth <reg orig="frigat">frigate</reg> and the constant Warwick chanced to part company, and it so fell out about midnight that <em>Beach</em> roving about, lighted on the <em>Constant Warwick</em> all alone, which before he came near, he took to be a Merchant man, and went on with an intent to board him; but the <em>Warwick</em> demanding who he was, he <reg orig="replyed">replied</reg> he was the <em>Portsmouth</em> <reg orig="Frigat">Frigate</reg> and for <em><reg orig="White-Hall">Whitehall</reg></em>. But the <em>Warwick</em> suspecting him, bade him round off. Then <em>Beach</em> perceiving his mistake, and seeing the <em>Warwick</em> to be a man of <reg orig="Warre">War</reg>, he presently made away; but the <em><reg orig="VVarwick">Warwick</reg></em> being a good <reg orig="Sailer">Sailor</reg>, made after him, and kept company with him all night. About 6 in the morning, <em>Beach</em> began the fight, firing 3. Guns, which were answered by the <reg orig="VVarwick">Warwick</reg>. The encounter lasted till two in the afternoon, at which time <em>Beach</em> and his men called for Quarter, and had it. He had five foot water in the hold when he yielded; he had 200 men, 20 whereof were killed; his <reg orig="Frigat">Frigate</reg> is a gallant new Vessel, of 42 Guns, whereof but <reg orig="thirty eight">thirty-eight</reg> were mounted. There are taken aboard with him <pb n="7" /> nine Captains besides himself, and divers Gentlemen, who are all prisoners. This is that <em>Beach</em>, the <reg orig="Ring-leader">Ringleader</reg> Pirate, who hath done our Merchants so much mischief this Winter, that he lived like a Prince at <em>Brest</em>; for which 'tis like he will receive his reward, being brought in hither, with the rest of his companions.</p>
