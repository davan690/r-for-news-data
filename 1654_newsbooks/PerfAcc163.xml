<head level="3">Thursday, Febr. 16.</head>

<p>This week was discovered a most <reg orig="bloudy">bloody</reg> Plot against his Highness the Lord Protector, and this Government; and after deliberate examination of it, these twelve persons under named are sent to the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Dutton, Mr. Roger Lee,</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Sawyer, Mr. Thomas Rosle,</p>

<p>Mr. William Jenkins, Mr. Christopher Watkins.</p>

<p>Mr. John Archer, Captain Smith,</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Bunce. Mr. Peter Middleton.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Parker, Mr, Roger Cotes.</p>

<p>If you desire further to be informed how this Plot was laid, I shall give you as much satisfaction as may be gathered out of the examinations of the persons aforenamed, which may briefly be <reg orig="comprized">comprised</reg> within these particulars.</p>

<p>1. That they had an Oath of <reg orig="Secresie">Secrecy</reg>.</p>

<p>2. That none should be trusted in this design, but such as should be adjudged absolute <reg orig="Royallists">Royalists</reg>, and true friends to their titular King.</p>

<p>3. That so many persons should be engaged for Officers to an Army <pb n="4" /> as should undertake for the private listing of 30000 men to be ready to rise at a time appointed.</p>

<p>4. That this design should be acted in all the several Counties of England at once.</p>

<p>5. That one party at the time appointed should fall upon his Highness, and <reg orig="murther">murder</reg> him and his Life-guard, and others about him, as also the <reg orig="Garison">Garrison</reg> at St. James.</p>

<p>6. Another party were to seize upon the Tower of London.</p>

<p>7. That when all this should be acted, their titular King, <em>Charles Stuart</em>, should be in a private place in the City of London, and be brought forth and presently crowned, and proclaimed King, and Proclamation sent forth into all parts, <i><unclear>That</unclear> <reg orig="Charls">Charles</reg> Stuart, eldest Son of the late King, was Crowned King,</i> &amp;c. offering pardon to <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg> and all others that would come in.</p>

<p>8. That this design might be carried on with the better Judgement, and according to the directions they received from time to time from their titular King, they made choice of 4 persons of eminency, to carry on this trust, but it pleased God to touch the heart of one of those four, who with a troubled spirit came and discovered this design to the Officers of the Army, and where some of them would be at such a time; upon which Lieutenant <reg orig="Collonel">Colonel</reg> Worsley, and other Officers went and apprehended the parties before named, and many others have been since apprehended, and stand committed.</p>

<head level="3"><i>A List of such as have a hand in this Plot, who are beyond the seas.</i></head>

<p>Charles Stuart, Lord Loughborough</p>

<p>The titular Duke of York, Lord Byron,</p>

<p>Prince Rupert, Sir Thomas Sands,</p>

<p>Major General Massey, Sir Thomas Armstrong,</p>

<head level="3"><reg orig="Fryday">Friday</reg> and Saturday, Febr. 17 &amp; 18.</head>

<head level="3"><i>An Ordinance of Explanation touching Treasons.</i></head>

<p>Whereas by an Ordinance, Entitled, <i>An Ordinance declaring that the Offences therein mentioned, and no other, shall be adjudged High Treason within the Commonwealth of England, Scotland <pb n="5" />and Ireland,</i> it is, amongst other things, Ordained and Established, <i>That no Matter, Fact, Crime, or Offence whatsoever, other than such as are therein mentioned and expressed, should be deemed, taken, or adjudged High Treason;</i> and whereas some doubts and question may arise, whether that Clause in the said Ordinance doth not extend to the Offences mentioned in the instrument, <reg orig="intituled">entitled</reg>, <i>The Government of the Commonwealth of England, and Ireland, and the Dominions thereto belonging</i>, and which are thereby declared be High Treason; For clearing thereof, and removing all scruples thereupon, his Highness the Lord Protector, by and with the advice of his Council, doth Declare and Ordain, That neither the said Ordinance, nor any Clause or thing therein contained, shall extend or be construed, adjudged or taken to extend unto all or any the Offences declared by the said Instrument to be high Treason, but that all and every the said Offences are hereby adjudged, and shall be adjudged, taken and deemed to be High Treason, and that all and every the said <reg orig="Offendor">Offender</reg> and <reg orig="Offendors">Offenders</reg> <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> suffer the pains and penalties of High Treason, the said Ordinance, or any thing therein contained to the contrary, in any wise notwithstanding.</p>

<head level="3"><reg orig="Satturday">Saturday</reg> February 18.</head>

<p>It is advertised from Scotland, that several parties of the enemies falling <reg orig="downe">down</reg> into the Lowlands in several parties have been taken by our Forces; four of <reg orig="Glencarns">Glencarn's</reg> own Troop have been taken, and eight horse, his Lieutenant, whose name is Rutherford hardly escaped. There was a considerable party of the Highlanders not far from St. Johnstons, who are very active since the drawing of our horse Northwards, but upon the coming of two Regiments more from England, our horse will be <pb n="6" />so disposed of, that the Highlanders will be met with in all places; it being impossible for them to move in the Lowlands, but we shall be at their heels to pursue them, or in the front to oppose them. But as the numbers of the Highlanders begin to decrease, so doth their courage, 10000 of the Arms, with other Ammunition and utensils of War, being sunk with the ship that brought them on the coasts of Scotland.</p>

<head level="3"><reg orig="Munday">Monday</reg>, Febr. 20.</head>

<p>I am informed that the <reg orig="titulas">titular</reg> Scotch King sent lately unto Holland, desiring the transportation of some thousands of <reg orig="Souldiers">Soldiers</reg> and Officers which he had got together: and that from thence a Dispatch immediately was made to the King of Denmark, to see what assistance he could get there. The Scots continue their <reg orig="plundrings">plunderings</reg> in parties, and oftentimes come short of home. It is advertised, that it is impossible for the Highlanders to have any considerable Body of Horse in the field until the middle of May.</p>

<p>The expected Ambassadors from Holland are not yet arrived. Our fleet consisting of fourscore and eight gallant ships, are put forth to sea. The <reg orig="Soveraign">Sovereign</reg> is making ready with all possible speed at Portsmouth; so are the Rainbow, the Resolution, and the Andrew at Chattam. Several prizes are brought in, some belonging to France, and some to Holland.</p>

<p>Mr. Peak and Mr. Powel have made Addresses for their liberty. The Brother to the Portugal Ambassador is this week to be <reg orig="tryed">tried</reg> in the Old <reg orig="Baily">Bailey</reg>. It is said, that Maj. Gen. Brown will be suddenly released from his captivity in Ludlow Castle.</p>

<p>More of the Conspirators were this day apprehended, of whom I shall shortly give you a further Account.</p>

<head level="3">Tuesday, February 21.</head>

<p>Several other persons besides those before named have been apprehended this week in and about the City of London, for being confederate in the plot or design, and other Warrants are issued forth against divers persons, who <reg orig="shew">show</reg> themselves sufficiently guilty by their obscuring themselves.</p>

<p>The Letters from Ludlow <reg orig="certifie">certify</reg>, that Major Gen. Brown is discharged of his long imprisonment there, and is <reg orig="comming">coming</reg> up towards London, where <reg orig="doubtlesse">doubtless</reg> he will not be wanting of returning thanks to his Highness the Lord Protector and his <reg orig="Councel">Council</reg>, for being more just and <reg orig="mercifull">merciful</reg> unto him <reg orig="then">than</reg> those that committed him.</p>

<p>From Dartmouth thus: Here are two ships laden and have hoisted sail this week for the Canaries, and from thence to the <reg orig="Barbadoes">Barbados</reg>, I pray God send them a prosperous voyage; we hear of more mischief done by the Brest men of War on these coasts, they have taken two English ships very lately, and have driven another in a small harbour on the coast of <reg orig="Cornwal">Cornwall</reg>, which was in great danger of being taken.</p>

<p>The Dutch Post is not yet come this week, yet <reg orig="its">it's</reg> likely he will be here tomorrow; yea some say their <reg orig="Embassadors">Ambassadors</reg> will be here by that time too, to <reg orig="ratifie">ratify</reg> and confirm the Articles of Peace, which some Merchants and others, take to be as good as done already, and for my own part I wish it as much as any, I have observed so much of their ways, that <reg orig="untill">until</reg> it be really done, I shall be apt to think with <reg orig="my self">myself</reg> what a miserable nation they are like to be, if at last of all they should not close with England.</p>

<p>The last Letters from our fleet, speak about 80 sail to be upon the Coast of France, and besides them there be about 15 sail sent abroad in squadrons, and as Scouts who have brought in 8 prizes. The main fleet of the Dutch is not yet heard of abroad, though we have intelligence they are very strong, part of our Fleet are going Northward; yet not so but they can <reg orig="joyn">join</reg> again in a few hours if occasion be, but we are now for Peace, and prepared for war. From Newcastle they write, that coals are likely to be <reg orig="plentifull">plentiful</reg> at London, for they have little to do there, but dig and send them away as fast as shipping comes thither for them. Three English Regiments are newly marched into Scotland (besides others went before them) and shortly you will hear the Highlanders have made the most of their game this winter, and will be forced to keep the Rocks and Hills in the summer for all the brags of Middleton, and the aid they are promised from the other side of the water.</p>
