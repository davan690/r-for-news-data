<p>The Intelligence this week is very smart, and full of variety, therefore you must expect brevity, yet we shall not omit <reg orig="any thing">anything</reg> that is material, either in word or action, and first we shall begin with a Letter out of <em>Sussex</em>, which certifies us, that <reg orig="yong">young</reg> Mr. <em>Wallop</em>, and other Gentlemen riding upon the Highway together, they met with others upon the Road, with whom they had some contest (the matter is not fit to be divulged because it relates to persons of great Estates) and in the conclusion one of Mr: <em><reg orig="Wallops">Wallop's</reg></em> company killed one of the other party.</p>

<p>In our last we gave you a full relation of the grand Feast made for the Lord Protector by the Representative body of the City of <em>London</em>, yet some things were then omitted of concernment, <em>viz</em>: That when his Highness went away, he Knighted the Lord Mayor of <em>London</em>, and gave him the rich Sword wherewith he acted that Ceremony, and to stop the mouths of any that should presume to object against this way of conferring <reg orig="Honors">Honours</reg>, be pleased to take notice, that his Highness hath power to create four Dukes, six Earls, and as many Knights as he shall think good of.</p>

<p>By Letters from <em>Stony Stratford</em> it was certainly informed, that one which kept an <reg orig="Alehouse">Ale house</reg> not far from thence, was seen in the company of one Mr. <em>Harris</em> a <em>Shropshire</em> Gentleman, who was afterwards found killed at the Redg-way, and upon question and examination before a Magistrate, this <reg orig="Alehouse-keeper">Ale house keeper</reg> did not only <reg orig="confesse">confess</reg> the <reg orig="Robery">Robbery</reg>, and murder of Mr. <em>Harris</em>, but also that horrid murder lately committed in<reg orig="Hartfordshire">Hertfordshire</reg>, where a man was found with his <reg orig="belley">belly</reg> <reg orig="ript">ripped</reg> open, and his head cut off, and thrust into his belly.</p>
<p>Letters out of <em>Shropshire</em> say, that the old Earl of Shrewsbury <reg orig="dyed">died</reg> last week suddenly in his Coach.</p>
<p>His Highness the Lord Protector sets apart some certain time two <reg orig="dayes">days</reg> in every week to hear, and answer Petitions, presented by the Masters of Requests.</p>
<p>Several eminent persons who have suffered long Imprisonment by order of the late Council of State, have now obtained their enlargement, yet Lieut: Col: <em>John Lilburne</em> hath not so much as Petitioned.</p>
<p>Mr: <em>Feak</em> and Mr: <em>Sympson</em> are not returned from <reg orig="Winsor">Windsor</reg>, and it is Mr: <em>Rogers</em> which declares it a part of his duty (as touching his Ministry) to speak concerning the <reg orig="Occurances">Occurrences</reg> of the present times.</p> 
<p>Major Gen: <em>Harrison</em> prayed, and preached lately at <reg orig="London-house">London House</reg>, he is now to go unto his own house in <em>Staffordshire</em>, and thereabouts to remain a while.</p>
<p>There is great joy in the Universities for the present Government under his Highness the Lord Protector, for that learning will be cherished.</p>
<head level="3"><i>By Letters from <em><reg orig="Civill">Seville</reg></em> in <em><reg orig="Spaine">Spain</reg></em>, thus.</i></head>
<p>The King hath put every year, both on the Goods imported and exported, new inquisition, in such sort that in <reg orig="Maliga">Malaga</reg> only, the English, and other Merchants pay <pb n="6" /><!-- the word 'one' appears at the end of page 5, but is not present on page 6--> 40000 l. a year <reg orig="then">than</reg> was <reg orig="payed">paid</reg> within few years last past, and by reason of a multitude of informers, and such as will make white appear black, the English Merchants have often been abused, and their Goods confiscated, I <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> only give you a brief touch how matters have been carried in some of their superior Courts.</p>
<p>The <reg orig="Judg">Judge</reg> of the <em>Almirentasge</em> in <em>Salsa <reg orig="Sebastians">Sebastian's</reg></em> in a Suit against <em>Nicholas Newman</em>, proved that <em>Lubeck</em> was Scituate in the State of <em>Holland</em>; In a Suit against <em>Francis Trivinio</em>, they proved that <em>Copenhagen</em> the Court of the King of <em>Denmark</em> did belong to <em>Holland</em>; In a Suit against the Tin Farmers, they proved by twelve Witnesses, that they sent a ship laden with Tin from <em>Cornwell</em> to <em><reg orig="Burdeaux">Bordeaux</reg></em>, on purpose to make <reg orig="peeces">pieces</reg> of Ordinance; In a Suit against <em>Derick Holt</em> they proved by fourteen Witnesses, that <reg orig="pipe-staves">pipe staves</reg> are of the growth of Holland, where the <reg orig="Intelligable">Intelligible</reg> men in the World knew there never grew wood to make one pipe stave: and for such like injuries there hath been many complaints, one whereof followeth in these words.</p>
<p><em>Bonaventure serato</em>, in the Name of the English Nation affirms, that his Majesty (whom God preserve) was pleased to grant to my party, the <reg orig="priviledges">privileges</reg> contained in the three <!--Royal Schedules??-->Roal Schedutch, presented to your <reg orig="Honor">Honour</reg>, wherein I require, and beseech to give obedience to them, as to his <reg orig="Majesties">Majesty's</reg> commands, and that I may have a testimony, from the present notary of this obedience inserted, with the <reg orig="scheduels">schedules</reg>, that they may be printed.</p>
<p>I demand Justice: <em>Bonaventure Serato</em>.</p>

<head level="3"><em>Thursday</em>, Febr: 16.</head>
<p>The Lord <em>Beverling</em> who is Ambassador from <em>Holland</em>, came with a message to his Highness the Lord Protector, and acquainted his Highness that he had received Letters from his Superiors, letting him understand that all the seven Provinces had signed the Articles of Peace (which you before as they were printed in <em>Holland</em>) and that some other Ambassadors are coming for the full ratifying and confirming them here.</p>
<p><em><reg orig="White Hall">Whitehall</reg></em> not being in a readiness as yet, his Highness continues for a time longer at the <em>Cockpit</em>. Several Officers and Servants are already nominated, <em>viz</em>: 2 Masters of Requests, 8 Chaplains, 4 Esquires above stairs, 2 Pages, 1 Steward, Gent: of the Horse, 2 Butlers &amp; <reg orig="Cuboard">Cupboard</reg> keepers, 2 Cooks and their Under officers, 1 Pautrey man, Purveyors, 2 <reg orig="Coach-men">Coachmen</reg>, 2 Postillions, 2 Grooms of the Stable, 12 Footmen, and other <reg orig="domestick">domestic</reg> Servants.</p>
<p>A rich saddle is preparing in the City, and a Fringe for Vallance of about 30 li. a yard.</p>
<p>From <em>Sweden</em> we hear that Arms are raising with all the force that may be, the like whereof hath not been known there before. The report goes that 20000 Foot, and 10000 Horse will speedily be in a readiness; the design is not yet known, and all things are carried very fair with the <em>English</em> Ambassador.</p>
<p>The <em>Highlanders</em> in <em>Scotland</em> do increase their numbers, and mischief. Lieut. Gen: <em><reg orig="Midleton">Middleton</reg></em> is certainly gone from <em>Holland</em> thither with about 200 Officers, and some Arms and Ammunition; Our Fleet is gone from <em>St <reg orig="Hellins">Hellin's</reg> point</em>, and plying about the Channel: the only Enemy that was in Arms in <em>Ireland</em> (<em>Mertaght Brian</em>) is come in upon conditions, but <reg orig="its">it's</reg> feared he and his party intend to go out again, if they can get to any <reg orig="forrain">foreign</reg> aid, which they expect &amp; boast of. The Lord Protector hath been proclaimed at <em>Dublin</em>. The titular King of <em>Scots</em> is said to be removing from <em>Paris</em> for <em>Germany</em> in some discontent, because that Court is sending an Ambassador into <em>England</em>, and because there is so <reg orig="neer">near</reg> a conclusion of Peace betwixt <em>England</em> and <em>Holland</em>, at which also all the <em>Orange</em> party show their teeth.</p>
<p>Many dangerous persons are apprehended at a Tavern upon <reg orig="suspition">suspicion</reg> of having a plot against the Lord Protector.</p>
