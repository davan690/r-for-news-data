<p>There are sundry new <reg orig="Frigats">Frigates</reg> making ready at <em>Rochel</em>, and at several other places in <em>France</em>, where abundance of provisions are making for war, and most of the Garrisons are <reg orig="re-inforced">reinforced</reg> and filled with <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg>, and their Castles and Magazines <reg orig="supplyed">supplied</reg> with plenty of Ammunition. Cardinal <em>Mazarine</em> hath issued forth <em>Orders</em> for drawing down the Army towards the sea coast, where they have not <reg orig="onely">only</reg> <reg orig="intrench'd">entrenched</reg> themselves, and raised great <em>Batteries</em>, but also planted above one hundred pieces of <reg orig="Canon">Cannon</reg>; and expect nothing more than sudden war.</p>

<p>The Lord Protector and his Council have set forth an additional Ordinance for the <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg>; a copy whereof take as followeth:</p>

<p>Whereas by an Ordinance of the 17 of <em>March</em> last, <reg orig="entituled">entitled</reg>, <i>An Ordinance for continuing the <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg></i>, it is next after the Rates therein specified, generally declared and provided, <i>That all other goods and <reg orig="merchandizes">merchandises</reg> (except Bolloin, Corn, Victual, Arms, Ammunition, Ordnance of Brass or Iron, imported, or to be imported) not specified, or therein rated, should pay after the rate of 5l. <em>per centum</em>, according as the same are charged by the book of Rates, for the custom to be paid by the first buyer one shilling.</i></p>

<p>Be it ordained, and it is hereby ordained and declared by his Highness, with the advice and consent of his Council, That the said clause be null and void; and instead thereof, Be it hereby ordained and declared, That all other goods and <reg orig="merchandizes">merchandises</reg> mentioned in the said book of Rates for the Customs, (except Bulloin, Corn, Victuals, arms, Ammunition, Ordnance of Brass or Iron and Wools of sheep) imported; or to be imported, which are not in the said Rates of <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg>, before or otherwise charged, <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> hereafter pay <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg> after the rate of five pounds <em>per centum</em>, to be paid by the first buyer from the Merchant or Importer, and the same to be collected accordingly. And to the end, the whole Receipts of the <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg> may be the better reduced into one Cash, and the charge and number of Officers thereby retrenched, It is hereby ordained by Authority aforesaid. That from and after the 25 day of <em>March</em> last, the Revenue of the <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg> shall be Excise shall be <!--this repetition occurs in the original--> but one Receipt, and so accounted for; and that all Receipts and Accounts heretofore taken or kept of any payment of <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg> or new Impost, by <reg orig="vertue">virtue</reg> of any additional Act, Ordinance, or Order of Parliament, and designed to any separate use or uses whatsoever, shall from thenceforth cease and be void, and be brought and reduced to one general Cash and <reg orig="publique">public</reg> Revenue. Provided nevertheless, that the <reg orig="moity">moiety</reg> of all fines and forfeitures, imposed and received since the 25 of <em>March</em> last, or that hereafter shall be imposed and received, shall be still kept in an <reg orig="Accompt">Account</reg> apart and be paid out towards the maintenance of widows and maimed <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg>, according to Ordinance of Parliament of the 13 of <em>July</em>, 1647.</p>

<p>And it is hereby for the further Relief of the said <reg orig="Widowes">Widows</reg> and maimed <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg>, ordained, That from and after the said 25 day of <em>March</em> last, there shall be, out of the Cash and Revenue of the <pb n="2" /><reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg>, allowed the certain yearly sum of 26260 pounds, to be paid weekly by equal portions out of the said <reg orig="publique">public</reg> Receipt, unto such person or persons, as is, are or shall be appointed thereunto by his Highness and his Council, and be <reg orig="intrusted">entrusted</reg> for <reg orig="imploying">employing</reg> and disposing thereof to the use aforesaid. Which said yearly <reg orig="summe">sum</reg> of 26260 pounds is to be in lieu of all and every sum and sums of money assigned by any Act, Ordinance, or Order of Parliament, out of any the Receipts of the <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg>, for relief of the said <reg orig="Widowes">Widows</reg> and maimed <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg>, other <reg orig="then">than</reg> the <reg orig="moity">moiety</reg> of fines and forfeitures before excepted; And the present Commissioners of the <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg>, or any three of them, shall have power from time to time to issue out all moneys, either delivered unto them, by the commissioners preceding them, or which hath, or shall be received by them since the 25 of <em>March</em> last, according as they are, or shall be directed by his Highness the Lord Protector, and his Council, or by Authority thereof. And the said Commissioners for <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg>, and their Sub commissioners, are hereby <reg orig="impowred">empowered</reg> to make repayment of the <reg orig="Excize">Excise</reg> to any person whatsoever, for any goods imported upon the Exportation <reg orig="therof">thereof</reg>, in such sort as the late commissioners might have done before the 25 day of <em>March</em> last, It appearing unto them that the duty of the said Goods have been fully paid; any former Clause, Article, or provision to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The Committee have spent some time in order to the regulating of the Law; and many gallant things are in agitation for ease of the people, and the due administration of Equity and Justice.</p>

<p>There is great hopes of a universal Redemption from slayers, and the enjoyment of true Liberty and Freedom is now arriving at the Haven of <em>England</em>, where 'tis hoped, the free born people in <reg orig="generall">general</reg>, will now suddenly anchor: <i>The Lord grant it; 'tis high time.</i></p>

<p>By the last Express from <em>Scotland</em> thus: We conceive the Enemy is drawing to their great <reg orig="Rendevouz">Rendezvous</reg> in the <em>Highlands</em>, we have lately been grievously plagued with their inroads upon the Lowlands, where they burnt and destroyed all that stood before them <reg orig="neer">near</reg> <em><reg orig="Dumfriez">Dumfries</reg></em>, and other places, the reason of their mischiefs and our <reg orig="losse">loss</reg> is want of intelligence from amongst them; for if we should hang up a hundred of them that we take, we should <unclear>scarce squeeze</unclear> ten true words out of them. Gen. <em>Middleton</em> we hear hath made his way out of <em>Southerland</em>, where col. <em>Morgan</em> thought to have <reg orig="ingaged">engaged</reg> his horse, <pb n="3" />but it proved not feasible; for indeed we have an enemy as subtle as resolute, and they play fast and loose with us in places of advantage, they expect the Duke of <em><reg orig="Yorks">York's</reg></em> coming to them, and their thoughts extend so far, that there will then be a general Rising of the people: <i>But alas (poor Gentlemen) 'tis dubious whether he will <reg orig="ingage">engage</reg> in the Holy War, as the Scots calls it; or draw his Sword against those which are sanctified, as the Saints term it.</i></p>

<p>From <em>Scotland</em> it is certified, That Gen. Monk is advancing towards <em><reg orig="Sterling">Stirling</reg></em>, and intends to cut his passage through the Hills, where <reg orig="politike">politic</reg> <em>Middleton</em> hath found a way to get through provisions, which causeth no little admiration; <i>for indeed we thought <reg orig="our selves">ourselves</reg> too sure to have <reg orig="starv'd">starved</reg> him out there; but the wisest sometimes may be <reg orig="deceiv'd">deceived</reg>.</i> He hath sent <em>Orders</em> to the <em>Highlands</em> to double their guards, and has placed his Army in <em><reg orig="battel">battle</reg> array</em>: yet no considerable action, but 7 sharp Disputes; <i>Let them laugh that wins; there's brave Heroes on both sides.</i></p>

<p>This day afforded memorable intelligence from several parts; as the concluding of a firm <reg orig="allyance">alliance</reg> and friendship between <em>England</em> and <em>Sweden</em>, with ample satisfaction on both sides. Yet before it could be brought to a period, great were the obstructions against it, especially by the Nobility: But the grand Chancellor, and his son Count <em>Erick</em> (the <reg orig="Queens">Queen's</reg> Commissioners) did manage this great Work with so great wisdom and dexterity, that her Majesty was pleased to vouchsafe her Royal Condescensions, to a final Agreement, and to manifest incomparable affection to his Highness, declaring unto the Lord <reg orig="Embassador">Ambassador</reg> <em>Whitlock</em>, That she would have the honour to make the <reg orig="Allyance">Alliance</reg> <reg orig="her self">herself</reg> with the Lord Protector, and in respect to him, and she said, because my Lord Ambassador treated with her like a Gentleman, <i>Avec tout a la franchise &amp; rondeur, &amp; non pas comme un Marchand</i>, she did consent to more <reg orig="then">than</reg> any other could have obtained from her. Nevertheless, 40 men of war, and 30000 Swedes are in a readiness to <reg orig="atchieve">achieve</reg> something: Mum for that!</p>

<p>From <em>Ireland</em> they write, That the Lord Deputy <em>Fleetwood</em>, and his <reg orig="councel">council</reg> of Officers, have ordered that 5000 horse and foot be sent to the North of <em>Scotland</em>, and col. <em>Venables</em> is taking care to transport 'em, <i>good shipping attend them.</i> The General <reg orig="councel">council</reg> hath cast Lots for the Provinces, for satisfying the Arrears of the <reg orig="Souldiery">Soldiery</reg>, and the Lot of the General Officers is fallen in <em>Munster</em>. The standing Army from <em>June</em> 1649 are content to take two Thirds at present. The Officers of <pb n="4" />the Army have <reg orig="joyntly">jointly</reg> subscribed a Letter to his Highness, owning the Government which is invested in Him.</p>

<p>Upon the advance of the English men of war towards <em>France</em>, and seizing of 4 of their ships, the Frenchmen rose at St. <em>Mallows</em>, assaulted the English Merchants in their houses, charged them with pistol and sword, plundered their houses, wounded many, whereof 7 are said to be dead; but the King hearing of it, set forth a <em>Proclamation</em> to protect the <em>English</em>. The <em>Dutch Pelican</em>, and a <em>Genoa</em> ship, are cast away by storm in the <em>Sicilian</em> Sea, with 15 <reg orig="Tuns">Tons</reg> of Gold.</p>

<p>His Highness the Lord Protector, and her Highness Protectress, are gone to <em>Hampton Court</em>. The Yeomen of his <reg orig="Highness">Highness's</reg> Guard wait by turns Monthly, and Mr. <em>Ingoldsby</em> (brother of col. <em>Ingoldsby</em>) is made captain of the Guard. Their coats are grey cloth with black Velvet <reg orig="collers">collars</reg>, and black Velvet and silver lace and trimming. col. <em>Nathaniel Fiennes</em> is added a member to the council.</p>

<p>The French Ambassador makes many applications to his Highness, by way of negotiating a peace between <em>England</em> and his Majesty (who is now of years to be crowned very suddenly) if he propound <reg orig="tearms">terms</reg> safe and <reg orig="honorable">honourable</reg>, he need not doubt of his Errand, <i>For it is a sign of godliness to be at peace with all men; yet peace cannot <reg orig="tryumph">triumph</reg>, except Reason ruleth.</i></p>

<p><i><reg orig="Edenburgh">Edinburgh</reg>, May 4.</i> This day came Gen. <em>Monk</em> from <em>Dalkieth</em> to <em><reg orig="Edenburgh">Edinburgh</reg></em>, attended by the chief Officers of the Army, who were received at the <em>Netherbow</em> by the <em>English</em> Judges in their scarlet Robes, and the Town Magistrates in theirs likewise. The streets were adorned with <reg orig="Tapstry">Tapestry</reg>, and a great concourse of people there was upon the proclaiming of his Highness Lord Protector, &amp;c. with Drums beating, Trumpets sounding, and Voices <reg orig="ecchoing">echoing</reg> fort acclamations. Yet notwithstanding, the Ministers prayed for the exiled Prince the next day.</p>

<p>There hath been a great plot discovered against the English is <em>Virginia</em>, by an <em>Indian</em>, who being privy to the design of the Natives, repaired to the Governor, unfolded the business, and told him that upon the 4 of this instant May, there was a conspiracy to fall upon the English, and to stab and cut the throats of all in general, both men, women, and children. Whereupon the Governor <reg orig="immediatly">immediately</reg> called a council, and forthwith secured the chief Actors, hanging up divers in several places. <i>A just Reward for so detestable Miscreants; and nothing but a halter can reclaim them.</i></p>

<head level="3"><em>Tuesday</em>, May 9.</head>

<p>His Highness the Lord Protector agreed upon a <em>Declaration</em> to be published, setting apart <em>Tuesday</em> the 23 of this present <em>May</em>, for a <reg orig="publique">public</reg> day of Thanksgiving, for the <em>Peace</em> concluded between this <em>Commonwealth</em>, and that of the <em>United Provinces</em>, and for the late seasonable Rain; a true copy whereof is here inserted.</p>

<p>That this hath <reg orig="bin">been</reg> a Nation of blessings, in the midst whereof so many wonders have been brought forth by the out-stretched arm of the Almighty, even to astonishment and wonder, <i>Who can deny?</i> Ask we the Nations of this matter, and they will <reg orig="testifie">testify</reg>; and indeed the dispensations of the Lord have been as if he had said, <i>England, thou art my first-born, my delight among the Nations:</i> Under the whole Heavens the Lord hath not dealt so with any of the people round us. The Lord having added another Link to this <i>golden Chain</i> of his loving <reg orig="kindnes">kindness</reg>, by giving us a peace with Our <em><reg orig="Neighbors">Neighbours</reg></em> the <em>United Provinces</em> (whereby he hath not <reg orig="onely">only</reg> stopped a great issue of <reg orig="bloud">blood</reg>; but we trust also given us hearts to unite our <reg orig="bloud">blood</reg> and strength for the mutual defence of each other) <reg orig="cals">calls</reg> for great Return of Thanks for the same. It is hereby thought fit to set apart <em>Tuesday</em>, being the 23 of this present <em>May</em>, as a day for Praise, &amp; for the thankful acknowledgement if this blessing of peace, which we hope hath in the womb of many other blessings. And let us not forget our other Mercies; was not the Earth so unusually <reg orig="parcht">parched</reg> up, that it <reg orig="threatned">threatened</reg> Famine, and did cause the Beast of the field to mourn for want of food, and water to sustain it? And hath not the Lord so watered the Earth, that he hath turned those fears into the expectation of the greatest plenty that ever was seen by any now living in this Nation? Consider we also the way whereby the Lord imparted this mercy to us: Did any amongst us foreknow it was coming? Was it not by stirring up our hearts to seek the same by prayer, and that <reg orig="immediatly">immediately</reg> before the Lord vouchsafed us this mercy? And doth not this bespeak? <i>1 That the manner of conveying this mercy is the best part of the mercy. 2 That, the Lord has not cast us off, that his Spirit yet strives with us, that he hath a <unclear>people</unclear> of his love amongst us, and loves the Nation so far as to provoke it to be in love with calling upon the Name of the Lord for better things <reg orig="then">than</reg> Corn and Wine. 3 That he knows best how, and when to answer the expectation of the Husbandman, and when to bear, even the mourning of the brute Beast, who will yet much more hear the desires of <pb n="6" />him that fear him, and that in the fittest season. 4 That the Heavens having thus declared the glory of God, and the Earth answering thereunto in its fruitfulness, why should not we be melted and <reg orig="softned">softened</reg>, humbling <reg orig="our selves">ourselves</reg> under these marvellous kindnesses, and abounding unto all fruitfulness in every good word and work of love; And if every place hath been made partaker of his <reg orig="showres">showers</reg>, why should not we (laying aside our differences) be <reg orig="inlarged">enlarged</reg> also each to other? 5 That seeing the Lord hath been thus universal in this mercy, why should we not universally turn from the National evils, and vain practices, which are yet too superstitiously and customarily exercised amongst us, which we need not repeat here, <reg orig="becavse">because</reg> they are too well known, and We trust will be remembered by those godly Ministers who shall be called to preach unto the people upon this occasion.</i></p>

<p>Given at <reg orig="White-Hall">Whitehall</reg> this 9th of <em>May</em>, 1654.</p>

<p>The Lord Protector, and his Council, hath passed <i> An Ordinance for further doubling upon and finishing the sale of Deans, Deans and <reg orig="Chapters">Chapter's</reg> Lands; and of <reg orig="Mannors">Manors</reg> of Rectories, <reg orig="Gleab">Glebe</reg>-lands, &amp;c.</i> Wherein is ordained, That over and above the sum of 300000 l. appointed to be borrowed upon the security held forth by the first recited Act of Parl. and over and above the sum of 120000 li. borrowed upon the Security held forth in the two last recited Acts, or either of them, the sum of 20000 l. shall be further borrowed upon the security of such of the <reg orig="premisses">premises</reg> respectively, exported to sale by the said Acts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As touching the Report of Mr. <em>Lilburn's</em> being <reg orig="tryed">tried</reg> and executed at <em>Jersey</em>, where indeed (<i>poor Gentleman</i>) he is a prisoner, 'tis false; <i>God forbid it should be so:</i> And this may <reg orig="onely">only</reg> serve for a confutation, that there was no such thing in agitation, but only a <reg orig="setling">settling</reg> of the <em>Government</em>, and adding 7 <em>Jurats</em> to the Judge of the <unclear><em>Island</em></unclear>.</p>

<p>From <em>Paris</em> it is certified, That the <em>Portugal</em> Ambassador has received audience of his Majesty, to whom he imparted the joyful <reg orig="Tydings">Tidings</reg> of a Victory obtained by the <em>Portugal</em> fleet against the <em>Hollanders</em> in <em><reg orig="Brasil">Brazil</reg></em>; and of the taking of <em>Reclif</em>, and about 40 other Towns and Castles from them. Which doth not a little <reg orig="rejoyce">rejoice</reg> the Royal Family: <i>Win gold, and wear it; 'tis fit <reg orig="every one">everyone</reg> should have their own.</i> Upon a delicate Banquet between the King and Queen, on the 3 of May, the K of <em>Scots</em>, and his afflicted Mother were both invited, in whose presence, his Majesty danced the great <em>Ballet</em>; but young <em>Charles</em> exceeds him far in the Italian Comedy. Propositions are preparing to be sent to the K. of <em>Spain</em> for a ten years Truce.</p>

<p>The Lord <em>Broghil</em> is come out of <em>Ireland</em>, with a congratulatory Message to his Highness, and the Lord Gen <em>Fleetwood</em> will be also in <em>England</em> suddenly. His Excellency hath caused ten men to be selected out of every company, for <em>Scotland</em>, which hath occasioned the <em>Irish</em> to gather to a Head in <em>Conaught</em>.</p>

<p>The last Express from <em>Scotland</em> certifieth, <i>That there is more men landed in Scotland, and that two ships from Dunkirk are come in to Gen. <em>Middleton</em>, contrary to expectation, with Arms and Ammunition. Major General Drummond is come up as far as Loughtay, and Lieu. Gen. Glencarn has reinforced Athol proceeding on very vigorously with their new Levies, and determining to <reg orig="spred">spread</reg> Northwards to surround Col. Morgan if they can. The E. of Montross is raising his Levies at Branar, and some of <reg orig="Middletons">Middleton's</reg> forces are united with them. They do begin to interpose very notably, and have taken and Oath of Confederacy to live and <reg orig="dye">die</reg> together. They are in <reg orig="dayly">daily</reg> expectation of their young <em>Master</em>, who has sent over sundry Commissions to be disposed of by</i></p>
