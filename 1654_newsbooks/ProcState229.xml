<p>This day, an <reg orig="addresse">address</reg> was made by the <reg orig="Portugall">Portugal</reg> Ambassador to his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg> the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of <em>England, Scotland</em> and <em>Ireland</em>.</p>

<p>There are some things, which for want of room could not <reg orig="bee">be</reg> inserted the last week, touching the Lord <reg orig="Protectors">Protector's</reg> reception into the City, at the Dinner at <reg orig="Grocers">Grocers'</reg> hall; At which time the Lord Mayor, after Dinner and the Banquet, was Knighted; and his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg> gave his own <pb n="1" />Sword <reg orig="wher">where</reg> with <reg orig="hee">he</reg> did it to him. Mr. Recorder was called for; but had been sent away upon <reg orig="speciall">special</reg> <reg orig="businesse">business</reg> before; But at his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg> coming <reg orig="in to">into</reg> <reg orig="Grocers">Grocers'</reg> hall, Mr. Recorder had made a Speech, which was thought fit rather to <reg orig="bee">be</reg> done there <reg orig="then">than</reg> in <reg orig="Fleetstreet">Fleet Street</reg>, and is as followeth.</p>

<head level="3"><i>Mr. <reg orig="Recorders">Recorder's</reg> Speech to the Lord Protector, upon Wednesday the eighth of Febr. 1653. being the day of his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness's</reg> entertainment in LONDON.</i></head>

<p>May it please Your Highness, my Lord Protector, it hath been observed by some, That when <em>Samuel</em> offered Sacrifice, <reg orig="hee">he</reg> therefore reserved the Shoulders for <em>Saul</em>, that he might know what was the weight of Government: The consideration of which made <em>Maximilian</em> affirm, That none who knew how heavy Diadems were, would stoop to take them up. Governors are like the Heavenly Bodies, much in Veneration, but never in rest; and how can it otherwise be expected, when they are not made for themselves, or their own glory, but for the safety and good of <reg orig="Mankinde">Mankind</reg>? as in the Natural, so in the Civil World, great things being ordained to serve the less: <reg orig="Wee">We</reg> see the Sun by its Beams, serving the eye of the meanest <reg orig="Flie">Fly</reg>, as well as of the greatest Potentate. The Supremacy of <em>Salus Populi</em>, was the conclusion of the Twelve Fables, and will be a prevalent <reg orig="Maxime">Maxim</reg> until the end of the World. By thus much, My Lord, You may perceive the dark side of this Leading Cloud of Government; but if God vouchsafe assistance from those Shoulders, upon which the Government is laid, and put under his Everlasting Arms, You will see the bright side also, and thence receive <pb n="2" />Encouragement: This Support his is pleased to give by letting Rulers know <reg orig="hee">he</reg> is the Author of their Power, and that from him they are to expect their Rule. The Designation of Government, as to Forms and Persons, is an Humane Institution, and mutable, as things that are made; but Government <reg orig="it self">itself</reg>, abstractively considered in its pure Original, is of a Divine <reg orig="Off-spring">Offspring</reg>, and can with no less difficulty be shaken, <reg orig="then">than</reg> those Vestigias which being as Relations tell us, upon the tops of some Mountains, above the Clouds, can be disordered by Wind and Tempest. And for the Rule, the Word, or Reason of God in the Divine Understanding, is the Eternal Law of all things. But this being too deep a Well for <reg orig="Mans">Man's</reg> Bucket to draw out of, it pleased his infinite Goodness to let fall a <reg orig="Rivolet">Rivulet</reg> from this Source into the Creature; which leaving an impression in <reg orig="mans">man's</reg> understanding, we call, The Law of Nature: But man having this <reg orig="honor">honour</reg>, presently became of no understanding; his <reg orig="minde">mind</reg> being clouded with passions and sins, had soon need of superadded helps, which God gave him, by those other Laws fit for Government, and still gives a Spirit for the framing such municipal Laws as are according to his Will, and suitable to the good of the People. But when this was done, the best Laws without a Government, were no other <reg orig="then">than</reg> as the Sword <reg orig="behinde">behind</reg> The Ephod; and <reg orig="therfore">therefore</reg> <em>Moses</em> in his time, and other Governors in their time, must be as Walking Laws, and Administrators of Justice. We may conclude, My Lord, Your Highness hath <pb n="3" />Experimented both these Encouragements, as being the Spectator of some, and the Subject of other great Revolutions which have <reg orig="hapned">happened</reg> in this Age, and Land of Wonders: And not <reg orig="onely">only</reg> know, That the Most High rules in the Kingdoms of Men, disposing them to whom he pleaseth; but also, That <reg orig="its">it's</reg> not sufficient with the Princes of the Nations, to exercise dominion, which is the common Image of God, except there be also a share in the peculiar Image of his Righteousness and Holiness; they being <reg orig="Gods">God's</reg> indeed, and after a peculiar manner, to whom the Reason, or Word of God so comes. My Lord, There is one help more in Government, which God is pleased often to <reg orig="adde">add</reg> to the rest, which is the giving in of the Affections of the People. The solemnity of this day, wherein the Citizens of this great City appear in their several Companies, as so many Cities within the City, speaks much to this; they leave it to other Nations to salute their Rulers and Victorious Commanders with the names of <em>C&aelig;sares</em> and <em>Imperatores</em>; and after Triumphs, to erect for them their <em>Arcus Triumphales</em>: But if I mistake not, their end, this day, is not any such outward Pomp or Glory, but that those who have been delivered together, might <reg orig="rejoyce">rejoice</reg> together; and to express their desires, That the Civil Sword might be as prosperous for <reg orig="Publick">Public</reg> Ends, in the Hand where it is placed, as the Military Sword hath been in the same Hand. This City seldom goes alone in <reg orig="Publick">Public</reg> Actions: it was anciently called by <em>Stephanides</em>, The heart of the Nation; and if the Heart be in a <reg orig="Politique">Politic</reg> consideration <pb n="4" />as it is in the natural, it will communicate life and spirits into the other Members, by which means the whole Body may unanimously contribute their desires and <reg orig="endeavors">endeavours</reg> to oppose the common Enemy, and after all our distractions, see the Nation established upon the firm Basis of Peace and <reg orig="Righteousnesse">Righteousness</reg>, which is the end of Government and shall be the end of my further troubling Your <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg>.</p>

<p>Divers Petitions were this day presented to his <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg> the Lord Protector, by the Masters of Requests, and <reg orig="severall">several</reg> Orders passed therein, for the <reg orig="releife">relief</reg> of several distressed and oppressed people.</p>

<p>The Council sat this day at <reg orig="Whitehall">White-hall</reg>, about the modelling of able and honest men to <reg orig="bee">be</reg> Justices of the Peace for the <reg orig="severall">several</reg> Counties of this Nation, to present them to His <reg orig="Highnesse">Highness</reg>.</p>

<p>A Committee of the Council sat about <em>Scots</em> Affairs, and particularly about Sir William <em><reg orig="Dicks">Dick's</reg></em> <reg orig="businesse">business</reg>, and others of the Scottish Nation.</p>

<p>Dalkeith 2 Feb. 1653. <i>The Enemy at their late being in <em>Badgenoth</em>, got three men from every four <reg orig="Plowes">Ploughs</reg> in that Country (except those near the water) but many of them soon returned back. The <em>Loquebar</em> men made good advantage to plunder when the Enemy were in Murayland, which when they had got they left them. The chief strength of the Enemy under <em><reg orig="Glengairn">Glencairn</reg></em> are now at Strathspey, and lie near the Lord of <em>Grants</em>, who (as is said) resolves to keep the house against them, having taken in some men and provision of Meal for that <reg orig="designe">design</reg>.</i></p>

<p><i>The 28 instant, a party of about 36 Horse came into the coast of Goury to the house of <em>Megnich</em> belonging to Sir <em>Peter Hay</em>, who had a very brave young stoned Horse which he engaged to the <reg orig="Governour">Governor</reg> of St. Johnstones to keep, the Enemy broke into his outer Court, and demanded all his horses for His <reg orig="Majesties">Majesty's</reg> Service, he <reg orig="denyed">denied</reg> his horses; hereupon they threatened to burn his Corn, he set the at defiance and fired upon them, whereupon they all ran away.</i></p>

<pb n="5" />

<p><i>But two <reg orig="daies">days</reg> after a greater <reg orig="partie">party</reg> came and fired both his and the Earl of <em><reg orig="Linlithgowes">Linlithgow's</reg></em> Stacks of Corn because they would not deliver their horses and maintenance to their Forces. Sir Peter <reg orig="Hayes">Hay's</reg> <reg orig="losse">loss</reg> is computed to be about 600 l. sterling. But I doubt not but as this usage will make them stink in the nostrils of the Country, so those who have suffered so deeply for their not complying with these rude people, will in due time be repaired by the Commonwealth.</i></p>

<p><i>Major Gen. <em><reg orig="Harrisons">Harrison's</reg></em> late Regiment have sent up their Subscriptions to the Lord Protector,</i></p>

It is reported that they will set out 20000 Foot and 10000 Horse, <reg orig="no body">nobody</reg> knowing for what <reg orig="designe">design</reg>. In the same time they do Negotiate very secretly with the Ambassadors of <em><reg orig="Spaine">Spain</reg></em> and <em>England</em>. Time will <reg orig="shew">show</reg> to what purpose.</p>

<p>The Lords States of <em>Holland</em> and <em>Westfreezland</em> begin to meet <reg orig="againe">again</reg>, and it is hoped that the other Provinces shall shortly bring in their Resolution upon the Articles of peace with <em>England</em>, and that soon after Ambassadors shall be sent thither, the common opinion being that the peace <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> be brought to a good effect. It is <reg orig="beleeved">believed</reg> that the fishing shall be free as formerly, and that the differences upon the <reg orig="businesse">business</reg> of <em>Amboyna</em> <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> be decided by Commissioners of both sides to be appointed, if it be possible, and that if the said Commissioners cannot agree <reg orig="there upon">thereupon</reg>, the same differences shall be referred to some Deputies of the Protestant Cantons of <em>Switzerland</em>. As also that the King of <em>Denmark</em> shall be comprehended in the Treaty as soon as he shall have made restitution and satisfaction of, and for the English ships and goods by him detained. The Lieut. Gen. <em>Middleton</em> <pb n="6" />is lately gone from hence toward <em>Scotland</em>, having with him, as they say, 200 persons.</p>

<p>We hear continually here of the great misery and desolation of the Country of <em><reg orig="Leige">Liege</reg></em> where the <em><reg orig="Loraigners">Lorainers</reg></em>, and Spanish Forces, those of the P. of <em>Conde</em>, and of the Dukes of <unclear><em>Wettemberg</em></unclear> do commit all manner of excesses, so that the most part of that poor people do <reg orig="flie">fly</reg> into <em><reg orig="Mastricht">Maastricht</reg></em>, into the <em>Bosh, Brabant</em>, and other parts leaving behind them their houses, their goods and <reg orig="cattels">cattle</reg> to the disposing of their Enemies.</p>

<p>Some Fishermen do report that some <em><reg orig="Hollanders">Hollander's</reg></em> and <em><reg orig="Zealanders">Zealander's</reg> Freebooters</em> have been amongst the English Fleet of <reg orig="Coales">Coals</reg>, and have taken some of them. We have lies reported here, that the Highlanders in <em>Scotland</em> are 12000 strong, and the <em>Irish</em> Papists 10000 and do great exploits in both places against the Forces of the Commonwealth of <em>England</em>, as also that the Countries of <em>Wales</em> and <em><reg orig="Cornwel">Cornwall</reg></em> with some others have revolted and are rising in <reg orig="armes">arms</reg>:</p>

<head level="3"><i>From Paris 30 January.</i></head>

<p>We have received <reg orig="Newes">News</reg> that the Town of <em>Beffort</em> is like to be surrendered by composition to the Marshal <em>de la Ferte Senneterre</em>. If it be so the Count of <em>Harcourt</em> may repent that <reg orig="hee">he</reg> hath not agreed before for the delivering of <em>Brissac</em>; His Majesty having offered him the last time 500000 <reg orig="Livers">Livres</reg> ready money, and that he should have for his retreat and of his family the <reg orig="Fortresse">Fortress</reg> of <em>Philipsbourg</em>. It is reported that the prince <em>Thomas</em> shall command the next Company to the Marshall of <em>Turennes</em> in his Army.</p>

The Deputies who have been met together a good while about the reconciling the said City of <em><reg orig="Colen">Cologne</reg></em> with its Elector have the last Sunday broken up their meeting <em>re infecta</em>, those of the <reg orig="Electors">Elector's</reg> side refusing to come to an agreement.</p>
