<p>This day some of Capt. <em>Welsh</em> his men coming to this Town, were <reg orig="staid">stayed</reg> and brought before the Landisher, who examined them, and sent his Major to the Lord Ambassador, to know whether he would <reg orig="owne">own</reg> the Captain, whereto answer was given, that his Excellence did own him, as one who <reg orig="hee">he</reg> did believe had a Commission by Authority of Parliament; whereupon the men were dismissed. But our English people have the more trouble here, and the less <reg orig="favor">favour</reg>; because the <reg orig="Queens">Queen's</reg> Admiral is a Hollander.</p>

<p>The Dutch Deputies are now gone over to <em>Holland</em>, yet there is some hopes there may be a conclusion of peace, which will be within ten <reg orig="dayes">days</reg>, or else none likely.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as it is apparent, That [notwithstanding my Proclamation of Septem. 27 last] many serviceable horses daily go to the Enemy, to the great disservice of the peace of this Nation, which could not be without too much connivance of the Owners or Possessors: These are therefore strictly to require all manner of persons, who now are, or hereafter shall be possessed of any serviceable horses or Mares, exceeding the value of 5l. sterling, to bring in the same within 48. hours next after publication hereof, unto the next adjacent Garrison or Quarters of our Army, under the penalty not only of forfeiting treble the value of such horses, and mares, as shall not be brought in, the one <reg orig="moyety">moiety</reg> thereof to the use of the State, and the other <reg orig="moyety">moiety</reg> to the party informing, but also be deemed as an open, and dealt with accordingly.</p>

<p><i>This day the Council considered of the business touching his <reg orig="Highnesses">Highness's</reg> Household, and made some progress therein.</i></p>

<p><i>By Letters from Captain Foster, Commander of the Phoenix <reg orig="Frigot">Frigate</reg>, dated in <em>Ously Bay</em> the 5. of <reg orig="Ianuary">January</reg>, 1653. was this day <reg orig="advertized">advertised</reg>, that he had landed the Lord Ambassador <em>Whitlock</em>, with the safe <reg orig="arrivall">arrival</reg> of the other ships and Vessels appointed to attend his Lordship, Decem: 17. Last at <em><reg orig="Gottenburgh">Gothenburg</reg></em>, where he was honourably received by the Governor and Magistrates of that City. And his Lordship went his voyage towards Stockholm with rainy blustering weather.</i></p>

<p>The 21. of December, he came out with his ship when the wind blew hard with much snow, endeavouring the Yutish coast, anchored in ten fathom water, and discovered a Fleet of ships; and December 22. in the morning got the weatherage of them, endeavoured to discover what men of <reg orig="Warr">War</reg> were amongst them, and saw only one ship of countenance, and a private Man of <reg orig="Warr">War</reg> of eight Guns. The Fleet being Hollanders, ran from the sound; and 72. Sail, some with 6. some four, others two Guns, upon our Guns firing amongst them, cut their cables and run towards the Sound; but before they got clear we boarded and manned three of them, which prizes were kept to the windward of us, and about 8 <reg orig="a clock">o'clock</reg> we engaged them.</p>

<p>After the passing of two <reg orig="broad sides">broadsides</reg>, the private Man of war ran after their Fleet, <reg orig="wee">we</reg> continued the Dispute <reg orig="untill">until</reg> 4 <reg orig="a clock">o'clock</reg> at night (at which time <reg orig="wee">we</reg> <reg orig="past">passed</reg> <reg orig="broad sides">broadsides</reg> close board and board as fast as <reg orig="wee">we</reg> could tack our ships.) The Enemy then ran towards his Fleet, <reg orig="wee">we</reg> pursued him, and after <reg orig="severall">several</reg> <reg orig="broad sides">broadsides</reg>, intended to board him; and though our <reg orig="Boultsprit">Bowsprit</reg> shot by the board, our Main and Fore-Mast shot through, scarce a shroud whole, our Hull much shot, four of our men slain, and eleven wounded; he <reg orig="fireing">firing</reg> as he retreated, yet we made him in such a sinking condition, that <reg orig="whilest">whilst</reg> he fired his Guns, he called to his Fleet to save his men, about 4 leagues off at Anchor under an <reg orig="Iland">Island</reg>.</p>

<pb n="3" />

<p>About 400 horse and foot were looking on us from the <reg orig="shoar">shore</reg>, we received shot from the Enemy of 36.l. weight. But night <reg orig="hindred">hindered</reg> our pursuit.</p>

<p>About three in the afternoon next day three Holland men of war, (two of them very great ships, being come from Holland to convoy their Fleet, came right before the <reg orig="winde">wind</reg> upon us, we then bore to our prizes, took our men out of them and would have fired them had we had time.</p>

<p>The last news from <em>Warsovia</em> import, that the King with all his Army, consisting of about eighty thousand men Horse and Foot, was upon their March to encounter the Tartars, and <reg orig="Cosacks">Cossacks</reg>, who are <reg orig="joyned">joined</reg> together, but remain asunder, being in two distinct bodies: By some prisoners lately brought to his Majesty, we <reg orig="heare">hear</reg> that the General of the Cossacks hath a particular Treaty with the <reg orig="Karn">Kahn</reg> of the <reg orig="Tartares">Tartars</reg>, which if true will exclude him from making any peace or accommodation with the Crown of <em>Poland</em>.</p>

<p>From Regensburgh thus: The <em>Diet</em> is not yet concluded there being new differences <reg orig="hapned">happened</reg> between the Prince Elector, and his <reg orig="Vncle">Uncle</reg> the Duke of <em>Simmeren</em>, about the enjoying of some Land which each other pretended to be his. Some Commissioners are appointed to examine the matter, and so to report it: as also some differences <reg orig="betwen">between</reg> the Landgraves William, and the Earnest of Haffia.</p>

<p>From <em>Dusseldorf</em> we are advertised thus: The duke of <em>Newburgh</em> is still at Malheim, being not well pleased with the Assembly met in this City, by reason that they have denied him the sums of money which <reg orig="hee">he</reg> demanded of <unclear>them</unclear>.</p>

<p>The difference between the City of <em>Cullen</em> and their Elector is <reg orig="neer">near</reg> agreed, he having set at liberty all the Barges and Boats, which by his order had been stopped at <em>Bonna</em>.</p>

<p>From <em><reg orig="Italie">Italy</reg></em> and parts adjacent came information thus: The Infanta Maria of Saucy is here at Rome, but yet as <em>incognito</em>; she intends to remain here for some time.</p>

<p>The Pope hath also given several <reg orig="Abbies">Abbeys</reg>, and other good Benefices to <reg orig="som">some</reg> of his <reg orig="domestique">domestic</reg> Servants, and appointed new <reg orig="Nuntioes">Nuncios</reg> to go into several places of those parts.</p>

<pb n="4" />

<p>From Genoa thus: <i>We hear from Madrid, that an Express was come to the Court to inform his Majesty that there was landed at Coronna in Galazia, three thousand Irish <reg orig="souldiers">soldiers</reg> who were appointed to Winter Quarters, which doth something startle the Portugals, who made a <reg orig="shew">show</reg> as if they would have besieged Cindad Rodrigo. The Duke of Tursie is also expected at Barulona with four Galleys, who are to bring good store of Ammunition and Moneys for the payment of the Garrison: One of the Spanish Galleys hath lately taken a very rich prize upon the French, being a ship bound for Marscillis.</i></p>

<p>From <em>Paris</em> Jan.9 thus. The last News from our Army in <em>Alsatia</em> imply, That the Marshall <em>de la Ferte</em> hath invested <em>Beffort</em>, and is now making his lines of Communication, and other works belonging to a siege; there hath been several pieces of Ordinance drawn out of <em>Nancy</em>, which are on the way, and will come to the <reg orig="Leagure">Leaguer</reg> as soon as any Batteries will be raised for to plant them upon: The Marquis <em>de Uxelles</em> is to be <reg orig="Lievtenant">Lieutenant</reg> <reg orig="Generall">General</reg>, and is expected there with three thousand men.</p>

<p>This <reg orig="Designe">Design</reg> hath much <reg orig="allarmed">alarmed</reg> the <reg orig="Countrey">Country</reg>, and so much the more since the <reg orig="yeelding">yielding</reg> up of the strong Castle of <em>Philipsburgh</em>, which was taken by a <reg orig="surprizall">surprisal</reg> without the loss of one man. The manner thus: The Deputy Governor being gone a hunting, with some of the high Officers of that Garrison, notice being given to one of the <reg orig="Cardinalls">Cardinal's</reg> creatures, he <reg orig="imbraced">embraced</reg> with alacrity that occasion, and being come into place, he so prevailed upon the Garrison, that he became Master of the place, and this Deputy Governor being come in the evening, knowing not what had passed, found the Bridge drawn up, and entrance <reg orig="denyed">denied</reg> him, whereupon he was forced to retire speedily. The Duke <em>d'Amville</em> being sent by the King to <em>Blois</em> to try once more if he could prevail with the Duke of <em>Orleans</em>, and so bring him again to the Court, returned back this week, and the report is at Court that <reg orig="hee">he</reg> hath brought a very good Answer, and that <reg orig="hee">he</reg> will <reg orig="bee">be</reg> shortly in this City; but others are of a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>From Milan thus: <i>The Marquis of <unclear>Caracina</unclear> our Governor is gone from hence to Uercel, and from hence to Trin, as also all the high Officers who were all come to this City to pass the time of the Truce, and are all come to the Army to observe the <reg orig="enemies">enemy's</reg> march.</i></p>

<head level="3"><i>Friday Jan.13.</i></head>

<p><em><reg orig="Iames">James</reg>, Earl of Glencarn and Kenmore, &amp;c.</em> These are straightly to charge and command you, to levy and have in readiness out of your Shiredom one hundred horse well manned and armed, by the <unclear><!--approx. 4 characters--></unclear> day of January; at which time you shall receive further Orders from me, to repair to such place of <reg orig="Randevouz">Rendezvous</reg> as shall be appointed: Whereof you are not to fail, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Our men are drawn forth of <em><reg orig="Edenburgh">Edinburgh</reg></em>, and other garrisons, and are <reg orig="busie">busy</reg> in chasing the enemy from place to place, and daily take many of these thieving Villains, and three Regiments are marched from hence towards Scotland, it is likely they would soon be <reg orig="quell'd">quelled</reg> if they would stand to fight.</p>

<p>From <em>Portsmouth</em> they write, that a Squadron of our Fleet have taken very lately six prizes from the Hollanders:</p>

<p>The preparations for War in <em>Holland</em> are very great, and they talk of some great matters agreed upon betwixt them them and the French, but nothing openly declared, till they hear what becomes of their <em>Treaty</em> with <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>From <em>Gottenburgh</em>, Novemb.30. After that Captain <em>Welsh</em> had landed the Lord Ambassador <em>Whitlock</em>, he put to Sea again, and met with two Hollanders riding at the <em>Scah</em>, the one 400. the other 350 <reg orig="Tuns">Tons</reg>, laden with Wheat, <reg orig="Rie">Rye</reg>, Wool and Planks, both which he took, and brought away with him, and by storm was forced to come a little way within this port, but without the command of the Forts. The Lord Ambassador was earnestly pressed to send for the Captain, and to discharge the prizes, but answer was given, that it was conceived a matter not appertaining either to himself, or the <reg orig="Queens">Queen's</reg> Officers to meddle with; and believed, that the <reg orig="Queens">Queen's</reg> ports would not be denied to any English-man who had Commission by Authority of Parliament, coming here to shelter himself against storms: That the Conflict had been upon the high Seas, betwixt the English and Dutch, who were enemies. For these Reasons, his Excellency the Lord Ambassador refused to do <reg orig="any thing">anything</reg> in it.</p>

<head level="3"><i>Saturday Jan.14.</i></head>

<p>By Letters from <em>Lime</em> we are advertised by a Barque that came from <reg orig="Brittannia">Britannia</reg> that one of our <reg orig="Frigots">Frigates</reg> having met with a Dutch Pickeroon <reg orig="neer">near</reg> <em><reg orig="Vshant">Ushant</reg>,</em> gave him chase, and followed so close, that he forced him to run on ground on the hither side of the Bay of Camaret, and by reason of his shooting hard at him, made the <reg orig="Countrey">Country</reg> to come down to the Water side; it happened that some shot did make execution on the <reg orig="shoar">shore</reg>, there being four killed and wounded; yet by reason of the night approaching, and the <reg orig="Countrey">Country</reg> being all <reg orig="alarumed">alarmed</reg> thereby, could not fetch her off; but ours put to Sea again, to <reg orig="cleare">clear</reg> from the Rocks before it was dark.</p>

<p>By <reg orig="severall">several</reg> other Letters from Scotland we received information to this effect.</p>

<p>The Highlanders continue their stealing, and plundering of their own <reg orig="Countreymen">Countrymen</reg> that will not rise with them, or pay the Contribution-Money that they lay upon them, though I am confident many have not <reg orig="wherewithall">wherewithal</reg> to subsist, paying likewise their <reg orig="Assessements">Assessments</reg> for the maintenance of the English Army; but when Major General <em><reg orig="Lamberts">Lambert's</reg></em>, Commissary General <em>Whalley's</em> Regiments of Horse, with Sir <em>William <reg orig="Constables">Constable's</reg></em> Regiment of Foot, which we hear are upon their march, are come in to us, we doubt not but to send this Heathenish and plundering Enemy so far back into the Highlands, as that they shall not dare to approach the Lowlands, whereby to do the Inhabitants any considerable hurt: And how the Highlanders are able to keep horse foot, is <reg orig="easie">easy</reg> to be imagined, all their <reg orig="dependance">dependence</reg> being upon <em><reg orig="Charls">Charles</reg> Stuart</em>, and his endeavours with the Dutch for Money and Arms; but a peace with Holland, (which we hear is in a very probable way for a very speedy conclusion) disperses them to their several mountainous habitations, without ever drawing the sword against them; and then the Lords and Chieftains amongst them, may expect a liberal of Justice for doing their Master such rebellious service, which hath been, and is destructive to the generality of Scotland, that a few months continuance will bring them the sad condition of the Irish, that have been forced to eat the <reg orig="corps">corpses</reg> of their deceased Friends after many days interment; yet are not the people of Scotland very much to be pitied, in regard they will <reg orig="seldome">seldom</reg> give notice to any of our Garrisons, when any party of the Enemy marches through the <reg orig="Countrey">Country</reg>, whereby they might <reg orig="bee">be</reg> the better preserved from their violences and cruelty, choosing rather to <pb n="7" />be willingly destroyed by them, then be treacherous, as they call it, to their own <reg orig="Countrey-men">Countrymen</reg>: Some Arms they pretend are lately landed for the Enemy in Scotland, but this is more to encourage their forced and naked party, <reg orig="then">than</reg> otherwise considerable.</p>

<p>We have received no News from Holland, since that the Dutch Commissioners set <reg orig="saile">sail</reg> from Gravesend: By way of Calice we have further Intelligence of the great fire that <reg orig="hapned">happened</reg> in Holland, which began at Waterland, about five hundred houses burned to the ground, and many persons perished in that fire, as also some <reg orig="Cattel">Cattle</reg>.</p>

<p>The contrary winds have <reg orig="with-held">withheld</reg> the Dutch-Post this week, so that a more particular account cannot be given from thence for the present.</p>

<head level="3"><i><reg orig="Munday">Monday</reg> Jan 16.</i></head>

<p>Concerning our Fleet by Letters from Portsmouth thus, <reg orig="Generall">General</reg> <em>Blake</em> and General <em>Monk</em> being now at London, General <em>Pen</em> rides as Admiral of the Fleet without St. <em><reg orig="Hellens">Helen's</reg></em> point, three Leagues from Portsmouth, forty sail of gallant ships ready upon any advice of the Dutch ships coming out to put to Sea: Some part of them are already sent out to ply between this place and the <reg orig="Lands">Land's</reg> end, and over upon the coast of France, to suppress the Brest and Dutch Pickeroons who of late begin to be strong, and have done much harm upon the Western Coast.</p>

<p>The Prince of <em>Conti</em> is not yet <reg orig="arived">arrived</reg>, but is expected here <reg orig="to morrow">tomorrow</reg>; there is a strong report that this Prince intends to match with one of the <reg orig="Cardinals">Cardinal's</reg> Nieces, but many are of a contrary opinion, which is truest, will be known very shortly.</p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor hath been this week at the Parliament, to have a <reg orig="Supersedeas">Supersedes</reg> to the passing the Declaration which is drawn up against the Prince of <em>Conde</em>, the same to continue for six weeks.</p>

<p>The Cardinal <em>de Retz</em> doth still lie a close prisoner, there being little hopes as yet of any <reg orig="inlargement">enlargement</reg>, his Antagonist the Cardinal <em>Mazarini</em> being very obstinate in the demand he hath made so many times, that he should resign his Coadjutership of Paris, and to <reg orig="intice">entice</reg> him the more, there is offered him the two rich <reg orig="Abbies">Abbeys</reg> of S. <em>Denis</em> and <em>Cluni</em>, which offer he will by no means accept.</p>
