<p>When <em>Alexander</em> the Great was poisoned by those men who envied the felicity of his Victories, you shall find that his <reg orig="Collonels">Colonels</reg> (for he was the first man that ever Marshalled his Forces into a Regiment, from whence they were called <em>Chiliarchi</em>) could find no other way to secure themselves but by the <reg orig="expirtation">exportation</reg> of all those who in consanguinity of blood had any relation to the King, <i>Occissis omnibus quicunque Regem etiam longingua consanguinitate contigerant</i>, so <reg orig="sayes">says</reg> <em>Curtius</em>. But if you please to look upon <em>Justine</em> you shall find that <em>Alexander</em> himself told his Commanders that the Empire of the <em>Persians</em> must fall by the height of <reg orig="it's">its</reg> own <reg orig="greatnes">greatness</reg>, and expect those men who were more able to Govern it; he will <reg orig="tel">tell</reg> you that every Commander by his Dexterity in Arts, and Arms was fit to be a Prince, having Nature as much his Friend, as his Resolution. No doubt they were gallant men who commanded in the Army of <em>Alexander</em>, and I do believe, not so much indebted to Age, as <em>Justine</em> would<pb n="1" /> make them, who at that time (in reverence to Age) according to the <reg orig="Stoick">Stoic</reg> Disciplines of those times, did follow the temper of his <unclear><reg orig="Socratick">Socratic</reg></unclear> Tutor, and when he did exercise the admirable flourish of his wit in composing his laboured History he was but a young Gentleman in the Court of the Emperor <em>Antoninus</em>, to whom by the Testament of his Father, and the relation of Consanguinity, he was bound to give an account of his Studies.</p>

<p>An Ordinance of Pardon and Grace to the People (and Subjects) of <em>Scotland</em>, is set forth by the Lord Protector; and the Persons and Estates particularly Excepted, are these,</p>

<p><em><reg orig="Charls">Charles</reg> Stuart</em>. The Lord <em>Machlin</em>.</p>
<p><em>James Stuart</em>. The Lord <em><reg orig="Mountgomery">Montgomery</reg></em>.</p>
<p>Sons of the late King of <em>England</em>. <em>George</em> Lord <em>Spyvie</em>.</p> 
<p><em>James</em> late Duke of <em>Hamilton</em>. The Lord <em>Chranston</em></p>
<p><em>William</em> late Duke of <em>Hamilton</em>. The Lord <em><reg orig="Sincleer">Sinclair</reg></em>.</p>
<p><em>John</em> Earl of <em>Crawford</em>. <em>Thomas Dayel</em>.</p>
<p><em>James</em> Earl of <em>Callender</em>. <em>John Middleton</em>.</p>
<p>The Earl of <em>Marshall</em>. <em>James</em> Vic: <em>Newburgh</em>.</p>
<p>The Earl of <em>Kelley</em>. Lord <em>Bargany</em>.</p>
<p><em>John</em> Earl of <em>Lawderdail</em>. The Lord <em>Nappier</em>.</p>
<p><em>John</em> Earl of <em>Lowdown</em>. Sir <em>Thomas Thompson</em>.</p>
<p>The Earl of <em>Seaforth</em>. <em>James Edmosser</em>.</p>
<p>The Earl of <em>Athol</em>. The Laird of <em>Womat</em>.</p>
<p>The Lord Vic: of <em>Kenmore</em>. <em>William</em> Earl of <em>Glencarn</em>.</p>
<p>The Lord <em>Lorne</em>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless provision is made in, and by the said Ordinance for <reg orig="setling">settling</reg> a competent Estate upon the Lady <em>Hamilton</em>, and other Ladies, and their Heirs for ever paying a <reg orig="smal">small</reg> yearly Revenue to the <em>Lord Protector</em>, and his Successors. And provision is also made that the persons hereafter named, do pay unto his Highness the <em>Lord Protector</em> his <reg orig="publick">public</reg> <reg orig="Receit">Receipt</reg>, the several sums of money following, in respect of his, and their Estates.</p>

<head level="3"><reg orig="Edenburgh">Edinburgh</reg> April 18.</head>

<p><i>The Commander in chief being willing to use all means possible to prevent the further spreading of this Insurrection (in which the people are mad from all parts to be <reg orig="ingaged">engaged</reg>) hath published the <reg orig="inclosed">enclosed</reg> Proclamation. The Forces in the North are much in the same posture, our Horse is yet at <em>Dingwel</em> and the Enemy in <em>Sutherland</em>, where it is very probable they cannot get away without <reg orig="Ingaging">Engaging</reg>. Amongst the party which were defeated about nine <reg orig="dayes">days</reg> since at <em>Kilowoch</em>, the Earl of <em>Selkeithe</em>, who was just run to the Enemy was one, the Rebels at his coming to <em>Abersoyl</em> took him for an Enemy shot him in the face, and wounded two others of his party. A party from <em>Dalkeith</em> this day took eleven Horse, and yet nothing but <em><reg orig="Barbadoes">Barbados</reg></em>, or the Gallows will tame, or <reg orig="suppresse">suppress</reg> these Rogues.</i></p>

<p>Now the Peace is proclaimed, wherein <em>Denmark</em> is included, we <reg orig="shal">shall</reg> briefly let you know what the <em>Hollander</em> hath undertaken in behalf of that King. <em>viz</em>:</p>

<p><i>1. That <reg orig="foure">four</reg> hundred and forty thousand pounds sterling shall be answered towards satisfaction of the wrongs done unto <em>England</em>.</i></p>

<p><i>2. That the <em>English</em> Ships detained in the <em>Sound</em> shall be discharged within 15 days after ours come to receive them.</i></p>

<p><i>3. That all other Damages shall be <reg orig="appraized">appraised</reg> by the first of <em>May</em> by four persons.</i></p><pb n="4" />

<p>We have lately taken a Dutch East India ship of 800. <reg orig="Tuns">Tons</reg>, wherein is four Chests of Silver, and other rich Commodities: we have also taken a private Man of War in the West.</p>

<p><i>Thus do you see how good fortune, joy, and glory (the three things <em><unclear>Thehus</unclear></em> asked of the Gods) attend the Lord <reg orig="Protectors">Protector's</reg> undertakings, and he who seeketh glory for <reg orig="vertue">virtue</reg> and noble Acts, doth not commit <reg orig="any thing">anything</reg> dishonourable either towards himself, or others.</i></p>

<p>We had more news from <em>Scotland</em> thus. A party of the Enemy commanded by Capt: <em>Erwin</em> lately got Westward, and came upon the borders of <em>England</em> in <em>Cumberland</em>, and <reg orig="plundred">plundered</reg> and robbed all they could meet with, &amp; carried away some prisoners. The Earl of <em>Glencarn</em>, and Sir <em>Geo: <reg orig="Monro">Monroe</reg></em> lately fought a Duel, and were both slightly wounded. A thousand more Foot are come over the <reg orig="Hils">Hills</reg> to their Army in <em>Southerland</em>. Coll. <em>Morgan</em> is gotten as <reg orig="neer">near</reg> to them as possible he can, endeavouring to force them to fight, and they give out that they will do it speedily. Some parties of ours have engaged with others of theirs, and always gotten the better of them. They talk of more Arms lately landed in the North. General <em>Monk</em> is newly come to <em>Leith</em>.</p>

<p>There will shortly be new Farthings for necessary changes, and the good of the <reg orig="poore">poor</reg>.</p>

<head level="3"><em>Friday</em>, April 28.</head>

<p>I made mention in my last that the blow would be struck before this time betwixt <reg orig="Collonel">Colonel</reg> <em>Morgan</em>, and <em>Middleton</em>, but the Letters this day advertise, failed in our Intelligence, for <em>Middleton</em> who knows <reg orig="wel">well</reg> enough how to <reg orig="mannage">manage</reg> the War, at the first News of the approach of the English Forces, did draw off his men from all places of disadvantage, and marched into the lower parts of <em>Southerland</em>, having got a part of the River of <em>Forth</em> to favour his Intentions, by seating himself where the River is most <reg orig="spatious">spacious</reg>, as also by taking all the Boats that made the River passable, and by <reg orig="fastning">fastening</reg>, and mooring the Boats on his side.</p>

<p>In the mean time <reg orig="Collonel">Colonel</reg> <em>Morgan</em> having made a long march, is at <em>Dingwell</em>, where he expected the Forces of <em>Middleton</em><pb n="5" />, who is said to labour in great wants, and not to be able to keep his Forces together unless some sudden Relief shall come unto them, which for all the noises of the Royal party to the contrary, to outward appearance doth seem impossible.</p>

<p>For some Letters sent to some private Persons do represent that if it were not for the access of those discontented persons who stole away from our Army to the Enemy, <reg orig="wherby">whereby</reg> some unexpected <reg orig="incouragement">encouragement</reg> was given unto them; the <em>Highlanders</em> who finding themselves frustrated in their expectation, had for a great part of them abandoned that desperate service which promised nothing but Death, and Famine, and betaken themselves to their own quiets.</p>

<head level="3"><em>Saturday</em>, April 29.</head>

<p>In the mean time it is observable that our ships entertained the Proclamation of Peace with the greatest solemnity that possibly can be; and General <em>Pen</em> being gone down to Sea, you will find what will be the Expedition which Christendom so much looks upon, whether they will go to <em>Legorn</em>, or the high Determinations of the <reg orig="Councill">Council</reg> so shall order it, as they shall call the <em>Turks</em> to an account at <em>Tunis</em> or <em>Algeir</em> for the injuries they have done unto the <em>Christians</em>.</p>

<p>You shall observe that there have been taken some <em>Dutch</em> Merchants, and the <em>Dutch</em> will <reg orig="perswade">persuade</reg> us that they have taken some ships of ours which they have carried to <em>Flushing</em> and <em>Enchysen</em>, they were taken on the Northern Seas; and if the Curious please to look upon them, they <reg orig="wil">will</reg> peradventure find them to be those ships which the <em>Dutch</em> Men of War did meet with, as I made mention in my last.</p>

<p>I had almost forgot to acquaint you, that on Thursday last the <em>Dutch</em> Ambassadors who were resident in <em>London</em>, were magnificently entertained by his Highness the Lord Protector.</p>

<p>The last Letters from <em>Sweden</em> do make mention that there hath been some difference in judgement betwixt the Lord Ambassador of <em>England</em>, and Count <em>Henry</em>, to whom the care of the English business is committed, but it is said the Queen will easily reconcile those Disputes.</p><pb n="6" />

<head level="3"><em><reg orig="Edenburgh">Edinburgh</reg></em> April 20.</head>

<p>There is yet no considerable News from the North that I can understand; for <em>Middleton</em> with his Forces are drawn into <em>Sutherland</em>, betwixt whom and our Forces, there is a Navigable River, not passable, but by Boats, and those the Enemy has drawn to their own Banks. In many parts of the Country there is all possible Endeavours used to carry on their <reg orig="Leavies">Levies</reg>, and not a few desperate persons continue their recourse to them. There has been several Officers, and others of them gathered up lately, and committed to safe Custody. In some of their pockets has been found a paper, called <em><reg orig="Glencarns">Glencarn's</reg></em> Declaration, <reg orig="stuff'd">stuffed</reg> with many expressions that carry little consistency with their Course. I may possibly help you with a Copy by the next.</p>

<p><em>Inverness</em> April 14. I can add nothing to my last, yet would not omit writing to you by this Post. <reg orig="Collonel">Colonel</reg> <em>Morgan</em> is at <em>Dingwel</em> with his Forces, the Enemy <reg orig="stil">still</reg> North of him, and past getting out of that Country, without either engaging, or dispersing their own force, <em>Badgenoth</em> and other parts of the <reg orig="Hils">Hills</reg> are quiet.</p>

<p>From <em><reg orig="Milford-haven">Milford Haven</reg></em> April 24. As for News in these parts, it doth afford little; the last vessels come from <em>Ireland</em> brought with them several passengers, which <reg orig="tels">tells</reg> us no further, save only that the <em>Tories</em> who remain hid in corners, are as ready as ever to do mischief but that they want strength, and so narrowly looked after, that they are presently suppressed, and driven into their dens.</p><pb n="7" />

<head level="3"><em>Monday</em>, May 1.</head>

<p>This Day <reg orig="Coll">Col</reg>: <em><reg orig="Prides">Pride's</reg></em> Regiment exercised themselves in <em>Tuttlefields</em>, where they had such new Arms given them as was convenient, <reg orig="too morrow">tomorrow</reg> they march towards <em>Harwich</em>; where shipping will be ready to transport them into <em>Scotland</em>, they all <reg orig="expresse">express</reg> themselves to be most willing for the present service.</p>

<p>It is advertised from <em>Scotland</em>, that <em><reg orig="Middletons">Middleton's</reg></em> Forces do <reg orig="lye">lie</reg> all along the banks of the River, to observe the motion of our Men, who will be with them before they are aware of us, some Forces both of Horse and Foot are expected from <em>Ireland</em>, so that let the Enemy stir which way they will, they shall find us both before them, and behind them.</p>

<p>In the mean time many men are daily snapped, who are going to the Enemy.</p>

<p>This Day in <em><reg orig="Hide">Hyde</reg> Park</em> there was the Hurling of a great Ball. Fifty <em>Cornish</em> Gentlemen played against fifty, one party played in white Caps, and the other in Red, there was a great agility of Body shown, and <reg orig="wrastling">wrestling</reg> proper to that Nation, at every meeting of one with the other, which was ordered with such Dexterity, that it was to show more the strength, the vigour, and <reg orig="nimblenes">nimbleness</reg> of their bodies, <reg orig="then">than</reg> to <reg orig="indanger">endanger</reg> their Persons. His Highness the Lord Protector was there; the Ball they hurled was silver, which that Party had, who did win the Goal.</p>

<p>There is a Report of the utter routing of <em><reg orig="Middletons">Middleton's</reg></em> Forces, but no Letters come to confirm it.</p>

<p>That which this week is most remarkable, is,</p>

<p><i>&#x261e; The Report of the utter routing of <em><reg orig="Middletons">Middleton's</reg></em> Army by <reg orig="Collonel">Colonel</reg> <em>Morgan</em>: <reg orig="Coll">Col</reg>: <em>Daniel</em>, and some Forces from <em>Ireland</em>; The List of their Names who in <em>Scotland</em> are Exempted from Pardon. The Hurling of the silver Ball in <em><reg orig="Hide">Hyde</reg> Park</em>, Fifty <em>Cornish</em> Gentlemen playing against fifty, and the admirable agility of their Bodies his Highness the Lord Protector, and divers eminent Personages being present. The taking of several Prizes, and the last News from our Fleet.</i></p>
